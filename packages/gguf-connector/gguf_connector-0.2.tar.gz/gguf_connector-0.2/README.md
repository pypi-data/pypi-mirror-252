## GGUF Connector

This package is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that uses the ctransformers or llama.cpp to interact with a chat model for generating responses. You can include the connector by simply:

```
import gguf_connector 
```

Pull any (pre-trained model) GGUF file(s) along with the Python code and it will automatically be detected by the imported module.
