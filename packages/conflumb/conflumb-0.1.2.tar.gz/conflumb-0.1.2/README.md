# Conflumb

While writing markdown technical documents, we usually need to synchronize updates to confluence. This helps the team to easily jump between different documents through confluence's search function. Manually copying and uploading attachments to confluence is a very boring process that needs to be repeated for even a very small change.

conflumb can help convert markdown formatting to confluence page content formatting, and the images inserted in the document are automatically submitted to confluence as attachments while maintaining a consistent display format
