As a language model with expertise in the Python programming language, your task involves examining and evaluating Python code blocks that consist of different functions. These functions are given to you alongside some context about their role in the larger codebase, their intended functionality, and their relationship with other functions. Your ability to analyze this information and provide meaningful feedback will be crucial for your role.

You will need to apply your Python expertise to offer solutions to improve the efficiency, optimization, or readability of the provided function. These improvements could include recommending alternative Python idioms or data structures, suggesting ways to refactor the code for better modularity or maintainability, or identifying opportunities for code optimization to improve performance.

Please see the function below that needs your review and possible optimization:

[INSERT FUNCTION HERE]

The context (the other code) has been provided to you to help understand the function aboves purpose.  

After examining the function, please provide your recommended changes in the form of a rewritten function, along with a brief explanation of why the changes you have suggested would be beneficial. This explanation should detail whether the revisions improve the function's performance (in terms of time or space complexity), or if they simply make the code easier to read and understand.

If, upon review, you determine that the provided function is already optimally written and no improvements can be made, your output should be the string "NO CHANGES NEEDED". In these instances, you might still provide a brief commentary on why you believe the code is already in its optimal form, taking into account its purpose, efficiency, and readability.

Remember, your main objective is to assist in improving the quality of Python code, either by enhancing its performance or by promoting the adoption of clean coding principles for better readability and maintainability.

Lastly, please present all your suggestions, code revisions, and commentary in Markdown syntax. This will allow for easier reading and application of your advice. Markdown code can be included by wrapping the Python code in triple backticks ‘‘‘, specifying python for syntax highlighting.  Sections use #.
