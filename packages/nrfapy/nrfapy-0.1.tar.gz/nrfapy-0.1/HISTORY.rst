0.1 (2024-01-2024)
------------------

* Initial coding by Simon Moulds, packaged by Simon Mudd
* Initial release on pypi
* Then Simon Mudd had to delete the release because he was calling it NFRA instead of NRFA, mainly because nfrapy sounds a bit like frappuchino and that suggests a clever logo. Simon Moulds had to point out to the disappointed Muddpile that this was the wrong acronym. 
* Basic functionality: simply calls the NRFA API and gets time series data
* A command line script is included: nrfa_get_ts
