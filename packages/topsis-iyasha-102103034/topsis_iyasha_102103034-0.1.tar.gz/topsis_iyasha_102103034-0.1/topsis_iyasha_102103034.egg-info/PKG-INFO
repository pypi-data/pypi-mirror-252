# Topsis_iyasha_102103034
Topsis_iyasha_102103034 is a Python library for dealing with Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems by applying Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).
## Installation
Install Topsis_iyasha_102103034 using Pypi via pip.
```sh
$ pip install topsis_iyasha_102103034
```
## Usage
You can use this package in python as :
```python
from topsis_iyasha_102103034 import topsis
inputFile="sample.csv"
weights="1,1,1,1"
impacts="-,+,+,+"
resultFile="result.csv" 
topsis(inputFile, weights, impacts, resultFile)
```
###### OR
You can use this package via commandline as :
```sh
$ topsis [InputDataFile as .csv] [Weights as a string] [Impacts as a string] [ResultFileName as .csv]
```
For Example :
```sh
$ topsis sample.csv "1,1,1,1" "-,+,+,+" result.csv
```
##### Please Note That :
- The first column and first row are removed by the library before processing, in attempt to remove indices and headers. So the csv  MUST follow the format as shown in sample.csv shown in the *Example* section.
- The input data file MUST contain three or more columns.
- The second to last columns of the data file MUST contain *NUMERIC* values.
- The number of weights, impacts and columns (second to last) MUST be *SAME*.
- Impacts MUST either be '+' or '-'.
- Impacts and Weights MUST be separated by â€˜,â€™ (comma).

## Example
#### sample.csv
A csv file that contains data for mobile models and their features.
| Model | Price (in $) | Storage Space (in GB) | Camera (in MP) |  Looks (1 to 5) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| M1 | 250 | 16 | 12 | 5 | 
| M2 | 200 | 16 | 8 | 3 |
| M3 | 300 | 32 | 16 | 4 |
| M4 | 275 | 32 | 8 | 4 |
| M5 | 225 | 16 | 16 | 2 |

Weights : 0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25

Impacts : -,+,+,+

#### input :
```cd
$ topsis sample.csv "0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25" "-,+,+,+" result.csv
```
#### result.csv
A csv file that contains the same data as sample.csv with two additional columns 'Topsis Score' and 'Rank'.
| Model | Price (in $) | Storage Space (in GB) | Camera (in MP) |  Looks (1 to 5) | Topsis Score | Rank |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| M1 | 250 | 16 | 12 | 5 | 53.43 | 3 |
| M2 | 200 | 16 | 8 | 3 | 30.84 | 5 |
| M3 | 300 | 32 | 16 | 4 | 69.16 | 1 |
| M4 | 275 | 32 | 8 | 4 | 53.47 | 2 |
| M5 | 225 | 16 | 16 | 2 | 40.1 | 4 |
