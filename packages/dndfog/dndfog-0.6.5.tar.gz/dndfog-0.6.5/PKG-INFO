Create battlemaps for tabletop RPGs, like [D&D](https://www.dndbeyond.com/).

> Program is Windows only for now. This is due to the saving and loading widgets
> being Windows only (using pywin32). You're free to modify the code to add file
> loading and saving for other platforms.

![Example Map](https://github.com/MrThearMan/dndfog/blob/main/docs/img/example-map.png?raw=true)

## Features

- Infinite grid
- Add and remove a [fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war) effect
- Import maps from image files
- Place, move and remove pieces on a grid (can be matched to image grid)
- Place 1x1, 2x2, 3x3, or 4x4 pieces
- Make markings on the map to show areas of effect or point out things to the players
- Save and load file to a single JSON file (no need to keep the image file separately!)

## How to use

When installing from [pypi](https://pypi.org/), the library should come with a script
named `dndfog` that you can run. It should be available in your environment if
the `Python\Scripts` folder is set in PATH. You can also download an EXE from
the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/MrThearMan/dndfog/releases).

When the program opens, you need to select an image file to use as a background,
or a JSON data file to load a map from. You can also lauch the program with
a positional argument `<filepath>` to add an initial file.

> The program does not autosave! You have to save (and override) the file yourself!

## Known issues or lacking features

- Matching program gridsize to background gridsize is a bit awkward
- When zooming, the program grid and background map might not stay aligned
- It's hard to keep track of combat, since there is no built-in turn order tracking
- It's too easy to accidentally remove fog you didn't mean to. There should be some way to
  layer fog, so that only some of it can be removed
- Markings do not scale when zooming
- There is no undo or redo
- There is no way to add pictures to pieces to identify them better
