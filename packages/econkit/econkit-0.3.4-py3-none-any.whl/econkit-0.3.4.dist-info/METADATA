<p>Here's how to use the main functions in the package:</p>

<pre><code>### EXAMPLE ###

## Import Libraries ##
from econkit import descriptives
from econkit import correlation
from econkit import stock
from econkit import table


### Run ###

# 1. Download Stock Information #
# 1.1 Stocks #
stock1 = 'ETE.AT'
stock2 = 'LAVI.AT'
stock3 = 'TPEIR.AT'
stock4 = 'EKTER.AT'
stock5 = 'TRESTATES.AT'
stock6 = 'INKAT.AT'
stock7 = 'EXAE.AT'


# 1.2 Preiod #
start = '01-12-2022'
end = '30-12-2023'

# 1.3 Frequency #
freq = '1d'

# 1.4 Function #
stock(stock1, start, end, freq)
stock(stock2, start, end, freq)
stock(stock3, start, end, freq)
stock(stock4, start, end, freq)
stock(stock5, start, end, freq)
stock(stock6, start, end, freq)
stock(stock7, start, end, freq)


# 2. Combine Multiple Stocks' Returns into One Table #
Returns = table('Returns', ETE, LAVI, TPEIR, EKTER, TRESTATES, INKAT, EXAE)

# 3. Find Useful Statistics, such as Expected Values, Standard Deviation,... "
descriptives(Returns)
correlation(Returns, method="Spearman", p="T")
</code></pre>
