"""CLI exposes terminal commands to python objects. Instantiate CLI with
one or more strings that are combined to a single terminal command.
Positional string arguments will be combined with spaces. Positional
arguments that are not strings are replaced with their string
representation. This is recommended only for common types such as ints or
floats. The CLI instantiation can then be used as a decorator on a
standalone function or on a method in a class. The decorated callable
receives an instance of the Res dataclass. This class has slots for stdout
and stderr at 'Res.out' and 'Res.err'. When the decorated callable is
called, the command in the decorator is run and the Res object then passed
to the decorated function as the first positional argument followed by any
other arguments received in the original call."""
