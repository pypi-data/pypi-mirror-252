"""The CustomField provides a highly flexible descriptor class. Use the
'apply' decorator method to decorate methods with a key value pair, with the
key indicating the name of the field this method relates to and the value
describing what access the method provides.

When instantiating the CustomField, the first positional argument can be

'getDefault' on the field instance itself. Please note that it is the
responsibility of the owning class to implement adequate accessor methods
using the apply decorator as described."""
