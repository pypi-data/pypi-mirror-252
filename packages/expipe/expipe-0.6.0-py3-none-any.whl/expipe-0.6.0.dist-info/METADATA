# Expipe

To facilitate data sharing, provenance and management of data and metadata we introduce Expipe, a semi-structured and lightweight data management platform designed for neuroscience research. 
Expipe implements a conceptually simple and familiar project structure and includes functionalities for data and metadata handling, retrieval, and exploration, which in turn can simplify the steps from experiments to analysis. 
Differently from existing solutions, the flexible and easy-to-use Expipe framework can provide an entry-level data management solution for both small and large experimental laboratories. 


## Installation

Expipe can be installed using pip:

```
pip install expipe
```

See the [documentation](https://expipe.readthedocs.io/)
for more information on how to use expipe.
