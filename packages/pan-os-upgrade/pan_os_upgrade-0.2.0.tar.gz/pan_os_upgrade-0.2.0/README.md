<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive Python-based solution for automating PAN-OS upgrades. It's designed to provide network administrators and security professionals with an efficient tool to manage upgrades, configurations, and system checks of Palo Alto Networks appliances.

Key Features:

* Automates routine tasks, reducing manual errors and saving time.
* Customizable scripts to fit various network environments and requirements.
* Extensive interaction with Palo Alto Networks appliances for operations like readiness checks, state snapshots, and report generation.

> Note: this script is targeted towards standalone and `active-passive` HA environments, no testing has been performed against `active-active` or clustered firewalls.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This guide will help you set up the `pan-os-upgrade` library in your environment, especially focusing on users who are new to Python and virtual environments.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or newer.
* Access to a Palo Alto Networks firewall.
* An active internet connection to download the package from PyPI.

### Installation

The `pan-os-upgrade` library is available on PyPI and can be installed within a Python virtual environment. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

#### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

The steps below highlight the process for creating, activating, and installing `pan-os-upgrade` into a Python virtual environment. If you're new to Python, it may be beneficial to understand why this is such an important step, [here is a good writeup](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to prime yourself.

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv panos_env
    ```

    This command creates a new directory panos_env which contains a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    panos_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source panos_env/bin/activate
    ```

    After activation, your command line will indicate that you are now in the virtual environment.

3. Install `pan-os-upgrade`:

    Within the activated environment, use pip to install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install pan-os-upgrade
    ```

### Setting Up Your Environment

After setting up the virtual environment and installing the package, you can configure your environment to use the library. This can be done using command-line arguments or an .env file.

#### Option 1: Execute `pan-os-upgrade` without Command-Line Arguments

You can simply get started by issuing `pan-os-upgrade` from your current working directory, you will be guided to input the missing requirement arguments through an interactive shell.

```bash
$ pan-os-upgrade
IP address: 192.168.255.1
Username: admin
Password:
Target PAN-OS version: 11.1.1
INFO - ‚úÖ Connection to firewall established
INFO - üìù **021201123456** DataCenter 10.0.0.3
INFO - üìù Firewall HA mode: disabled
INFO - üìù Current PAN-OS version: 11.0.2
INFO - üìù Target PAN-OS version: 11.1.1
INFO - ‚úÖ Confirmed that moving from 11.0.2 to 11.1.1 is an upgrade
...continue until completed...
```

#### Option 2: Execute `pan-os-upgrade` Using Command-Line Arguments

Alternatively, you can pass these details as command-line arguments when running the script:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade --ip-address 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0
```

For a dry run:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade --ip-address 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0 --dry-run
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The script can be run from the command line with various options.

You can view all arguments by passing the `--help` flag:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade --help
```

### CLI Arguments Description

<!-- OUTPUT -->
## Output

The script generates several files containing the state of the firewall and readiness checks. These files are stored in the `assurance` directory with the following structure:

* `snapshots`: Contains the pre and post-upgrade network state snapshots in JSON format.
* `readiness_checks`: Contains the results of readiness checks in JSON format.
* `configurations`: Contains the backup of the firewall's configuration in XML format.

<!-- LOGGING -->
## Logging

Log messages are printed to the console and saved to a rotating log file located in the `logs` directory. The log level can be set via the `--log-level` argument.

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

Encountered an issue? Here are some common problems and solutions:

* **Problem**: Script fails to connect to the PAN-OS device.
  * **Solution**: Check if the hostname and credentials are correct. Ensure network connectivity to the PAN-OS device.

* **Problem**: Script hangs during execution.
  * **Solution**: Check the firewall and network settings. Ensure the PAN-OS device is responding correctly.
