Use OpenAI to scan your code for security issues from the CLI. Bring your own OpenAI token. Options to scan full code, code changes, or in pipeline.

# Install

```bash
pip install latio

OPENAI_API_KEY=xxx latio partial ./ 
```

# How to Run Locally

1. Get your OpenAI key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. `export OPENAI_API_KEY=<OpenAPI Key>`
3. Scan only your changed files before merging with `python latio partial /path/to/directory`. This uses the GPT-3.5-turbo model so it's cheap and fast.
4. Scan your full application with `python latio full /path/to/directory`. This uses the beta model of gpt-4 so it's extremely expensive. Scanning this application once for example took about $1. Additionally, you may need to split your app into smaller directories, because the model has a 128,000 token limit 
5. You can specify `--model` with the [model name from open ai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to experiment

# How to Run in Pipeline

This will run OpenAI in pipeline against only your changed files. [Here's an example](https://github.com/latiotech/insecure-kubernetes-deployments/actions/runs/7081197080/job/19270126283?pr=6) of what it looks like, it uses GPT-3.5 to scan only changed files, so it's relatively cheap.

1. Get your OpenAI token from [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. In your repository, go to `github.com/org/repo/settings/secrets/actions` and add a new Repository Secret called `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the value from OpenAI
3. Copy and paste the `.github/workflows/actions-template.yml` into your own `.github/workflows/` folder

# Command Line Options

## `latio partial <directory> [--model <model_name>]`

Scans only the files that have been changed in the specified directory.

- `<directory>`: Path to the directory where your project is located.
- `--model <model_name>`: (Optional) Specifies the name of the OpenAI model to use for the scan. Defaults to `gpt-3.5-turbo`

Example:
```bash
latio partial /path/to/your/project --model gpt-3.5-turbo
```

## `latio full <directory> [--model <model_name>]`

Scans only the files that have been changed in the specified directory.

- `<directory>`: Path to the directory where your project is located.
- `--model <model_name>`: (Optional) Specifies the name of the OpenAI model to use for the scan. Defaults to `gpt-4-1106-preview`

Example:
```bash
latio full /path/to/your/project --model gpt-4-1106-preview
```
