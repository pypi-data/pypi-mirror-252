# CHANGELOG

Changelog for the grscheller.datastrucures PyPI project.
Version numbers for PyPI releases begin with a `v`.

Semantic Versioning will be used:

* Semantic versioning for PyPI releases:
  * first digit means
    * A major event, epoch, or paradigm shift
  * second digit means
    * PyPI breaking API changes or PyPI major changes
  * third digit either means
    * PyPI API additions, PyPI bugfixes or minor changes
    * Significant documentation updates

## Version v0.12.3 - PyPI Release date 2024-01-20

* cutting next PyPI release from development (main)
  * if experiment works, will drop release branch
  * will not include `docs/`
  * will not include `.gitignore` and `.github/`
  * will include `tests/`
  * made pytest >= 7.4 an optional test dependency

## Version v0.12.2 - PyPI Release date 2024-01-17

* designing sensible reduce & accumulate overrides for Maybe & Either
  * default implementations were not that useful
  * taking their behavior as bugs and not API changes
  * more tests for accumulate & reduce
* fixed Stack reverse() method
  * should have caught this when I fixed FStack on last PyPI release
  * more Stack tests
* many more FP tests

## Version v0.12.1 - PyPI Release date 2024-01-15

* BUG FIX: FStack reverse() method
* added more tests

## Version v0.12.0 - PyPI Release date 2024-01-14

* Considerable future-proofing for first real Beta release

## Version 0.11.3.4 - Finally decided to make next PyPI release Beta

* Package structure mature and not subject to change beyond additions
* Will endeavor to keep top level & core module names the same
* API changes will be deprecated before removed

## Version v0.11.0 - PyPI Release date 2023-12-20

* A lot of work done on class CLArray
  * probably will change its name before the next PyPI Release
    * perhaps to "ProcessArray" or "PArray"
* Keeping this release an Alpha version
  * mostly for the freedom to rename and restructure the package

## Version 0.10.17.0+ (0.11.0-RC2) - 2023-12-17

* Second release candidate - probably will become next PyPI release
  * main now development branch, release will be release branch
  * decided to drop it back to Alpha
    * making datastrucutes a Beta release was premature
    * classifier "Development Status :: 3 - Alpha"
  * will cut next PyPI release with Flit from release branch
  * will need to regenerate docs on release & move to main
  * things to add in main before next release
    * will not make Maybe Nothing a singleton
    * last touched CLArray refactor
    * improve CLArray test coverage
  * Things for future PYPI releases
    * inherit FTuple from Tuple (use __new__) for performance boost
    * hold off using __slots__ until I understand them better

## Version 0.10.14.2 (0.11.0-RC1) - 2023-12-11

* First release candidate - unlikely this will be the next PyPI release
  * will cut next PyPI release with Flit from main branch
  * removed docs direrctory before merge (docs/ will be main only)
  * things to add in main before next release
    * make Maybe Nothing a singleton (use __new__)
    * derive FTuple from Tuple (use __new__) for performance boost
    * simplify CLArray to use a Queue instead of CircularArray & iterator
    * start using __slots__ for performance boost to data structures
      * efficiency trumps extensibility
      * prevents client code adding arbitrary attributes & methods
      * smalled size & quicker method/attribute lookups
      * big difference when dealing with huge number of data structures

## Version 0.10.14.0 - commit date 2023-12-09

* Finished massive renaming & repackaging effort
  * to help with future growth in future
  * name choices more self documenting
  * top level modules

      * FIFOQueue (formerly SQueue)
      * LIFOQueue (LIFO version of above)
      * DoubleQueue (formerly DQueue)
    * stack
      * Stack (formerly PStack)
      * FStack

* More or less finalized FCLArray API
  * finished overriding default flatMap, mergeMap & exhaustMap from FP
  * need mergeMap & exhaustMap versions of unit tests

  * 0.10.7.X will be used on the GitHub pypy3 branch
    * Pypy3 (7.3.13) using Python (3.10.13)
    * tests pass but are 4X slower
    * LSP almost useless due to more primative typing module

## Version 0.10.7.0 - commit date 2023-11-18

* Overhauled __repr__ & __str__ methods for all classes
  * tests that ds == eval(repr(ds)) fo all data structures ds in package
* CLArray API is in a state of flux

* All iterators conform to Python language "iterator protocol"
* Improved docstrings
* Future directions:
  * Develop some "typed" containers
  * Add sequence & transverse methods to functional subpackage classes
  * Monad transformers???
  * Need to use this package in other projects to gain insight

## Version v0.8.6.0 - PyPI release date: 2023-11-05

* LSP with Pyright working quite well
* Goals for next PyPI release:
  * combine methods
    * tail and tailOr
    * cons and consOr
    * head and headOr

## Version 0.8.4.0 - commit date 2023-11-03

* new data structure FTuple added
  * wrapped tuple with a FP interface
  * initial minimal viable product

## Version 0.8.3.0 - commit date 2023-11-02

  * Dqueue renamed DQueue
  * FLarray renamed FLArray
* tests now work

## Version 0.8.0.0 - commit date 2023-10-28

* API breaking changes
  * did not find everything returning self upon mutation
* Efforts for future directions
  * decided to use pdoc3 over sphinx to generate API documentation
  * need to resolve tension of package being Pythonic and Functional

## Version 0.7.5.0 - commit date 2023-10-26

* moved pytest testsuite to root of the repo
  * src/grscheller/datastrucures/tests -> tests/
  * seems to be the canonical location of a testsuite
* instructions to run testsuite in tests/__init__.py

## Version v0.7.4.0 - PyPI release date: 2023-10-25

* More mature
* More Pythonic
* Major API changes
* Still tagging it an Alpha release

## Version 0.7.2.0 - commit date 2023-10-18

* Queue & Dqueue no longer return Maybe objects
  * Neither store None as a value
  * Now safe to return None for non-existent values
    * like popping or peaking from an empty queue or dqueue

## Version 0.7.0.0 - commit date 2023-10-16

* added Queue data structure repreenting a FIFO queue
* renamed two Dqueue methods
  * headR -> peakLastIn
  * headL -> peakNextOut
* went ahead and removed Stack head method
  * fair since I still labeling releases as alpha releases
  * the API is still a work in progress
* updated README.md
  * foreshadowing making a distinction between
    * objects "sharing" their data -> FP methods return copies
    * objects "contain" their data -> FP methods mutate object
  * added info on class Queue

## Version v0.6.9.0 - PyPI release date: 2023-10-09

* deprecated Stack head() method
  * replaced with peak() method
* renamed core module to iterlib module
  * library just contained functions for manimulating iterators
  * TODO: use mergeIters as a guide for an iterator "zip" function
* class Stack better in alignment with:
  * Python lists
    * more natural for Stack to iterate backwards starting from head
    * removed Stack's __getitem__ method
    * both pop and push/append from end
  * Dqueue which wraps a Circle instance
    * also Dqueue does not have a __getitem__ method
  * Circle which implements a circular array with a Python List
  * Stack now implements map, flatMap, mergeMap methods
    * each returns a new Stack instance, with new nodes

## Version 0.6.8.6 - commit date: 2023-10-08

* 3 new methods for class Circle and Dqueue
  * mapSelf, flatMapSelf, mergeMapSelf
    * these correspond to map, flatMap, mergeMap
    * except they act on the class objects themselves, not new instances
* these new methods will NOT be added to the Stack class
  * they would destroy node sharing
  * did add a map method which returns a new instance (with new nodes)
  * TODO: add flatMap and mergeMap methods
* probably will add them to the Dqueue class too
  * not worth the maintenance effort maintaining two version of Dqueue
    * one returning new instances
    * the other modifying the object in place

## Version 0.6.8.3 - commit date: 2023-10-06

* Stack now works with Python Reversed builtin function
  * using a __reversed__ method which is O(n)
  * never figured out why reversed() failed with __getitems__ & __len__
    * this would have been O(n^2) anyway
* Stack no longer implements the __getitems__ method
* class Carray renamed to Circle
  * implements a circular array based on a Python List
  * resizes itself as needed
  * will handle None values being pushed and popped from it
  * implemented in the grscheller.datastructures.circle module
    * in the src/grscheller/datastructures/circle.py file
  * O(1) pushing/popping to/from either end
  * O(1) length determination
  * O(1) indexing for setting and getting values.
* Dqueue implemented with Circle class instead of List class directly
* Ensured that None is never pushed to Stack & Dqueue objects


## Version 0.6.4.1 - commit date: 2023-10-01

* Initial prototypes for map and flatMap for Dqueue class
* Started grscheller.datastructures.core module
  * used for grscheller.datastructures implementation
  * no particular need to indicate them to be _private
  * exports the following functions so far
    * concatIters - sequentially concatenate multiple iterators
    * mergeIters - merge multiple iterators until one is exhausted
    * mapIter - lazily map a function over an iterator stream
* Decided to keep Alpha for next PyPI release

## Version 0.6.3.2 - commit date: 2023-09-30

* Made functional module into a sub package of datastructures
* Improved comments and type annotations
* Removed isEmpty method from Dqueue class
* Both Dqueue & Stack objects evaluate true when non-empty
* Beginning preparations for the next PyPI release
  * Want to make next PyPI release a Beta release
  * Need to improve test suite first

## Version 0.6.2.0 - commit date: 2023-09-25

* Started work on a Left biased Either Monad
* removed isEmpty method from Stack class

## Version 0.6.1.0 - commit date: 2023-09-25

* Maybe get() and getOrElse() API changes
* getting a better handle on type annotation
  * work-in-progress

## Version v0.5.2.1 - PyPI release date: 2023-09-24

* data structures now support a much more FP style for Python
  * implemented Maybe monad
  * introduces the use of type annotations for this effort
  * much better test coverage

## Version 0.5.0.0 - commit date: 2023-09-20

* begin work on a more functional approach
  * create a monadic Option class
  * drop the subclassing of NONE
  * put this effort on a new branch: feature_maybe
* some flaws with previous approach
  * the OO redirection not best
    * for a class used in computationally intense contexts
    * adds way too much complexity to the design
  * some Python library probably already implemented this
    * without looking, these probably throw tons of exceptions
    * more fun implementing it myself
      * then being dissatified with someone else's design

## Version 0.4.0.0 - commit date: 2023-09-11

* subtle paradigm shift for Stack class
  * empty Stacks no longer returned for nonexistent stacks
    * like the tail of an empty stack
    * singleton Stack.stackNONE class object returned instead
