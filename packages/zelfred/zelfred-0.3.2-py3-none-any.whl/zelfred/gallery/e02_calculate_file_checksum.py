"""
Feature:

The user enters (or paste) the absolute path of the file, and the UI generates
a few checksum algorithm options, then user can choose one and hit "Enter" to
copy the checksum value of the selected algorithm. The UI will stay and user can
continue to choose another algorithm and hit "Enter" again.

Difficulty: Easy

Dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyperclip>=1.8.0,<2.0.0
