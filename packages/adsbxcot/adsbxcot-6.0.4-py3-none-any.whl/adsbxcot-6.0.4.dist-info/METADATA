Display Aircraft in TAK
***********************

ADSBXCOT is a PyTAK gateway for displaying aircraft tracks from ADS-B Aggregators in `TAK Products <https://tak.gov>`_, including ATAK, WinTAK & iTAK.

ADSBXCOT converts ADS-B messages from aircraft into Cursor on Target (CoT), as spoken by TAK. ADS-B messages are read from global ADS-B data aggregators. ADS-B data sent to TAK retains much of the aircraft's track, course & speed parameters, and includes other metadata about the aircraft: Flight, Tail, Category, and et al.

ADSBXCOT runs in any Python 3.6+ environment, on both Windows & Linux.

**N.B.**: Almost all ADS-B Aggreators require pre-authorization before allowing access to ADS-B data. This pre-authorization is often in the form of an API key. Many of these services provide these API keys for free, provided you feed data from your local ADS-B receiver into their cloud-service. Otherwise, they charge a fee for access to ADS-B data. Your organization should reach out to these ADS-B data aggregator services directly to negotiate terms for your use.

`Documentation is available here. <https://adsbxcot.rtfd.io>`_
