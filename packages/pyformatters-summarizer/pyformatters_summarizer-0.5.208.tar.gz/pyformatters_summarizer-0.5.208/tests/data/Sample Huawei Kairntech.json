    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- With tech earnings looming this month, investor attention is zeroing in on some of Asia\u2019s largest chipmakers. And there\u2019s reason for it: the sector\u2019s influence on the region\u2019s stocks has kept on growing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is set to report fourth-quarter results Thursday, potentially hitting record revenue of more than $10.2 billion and its highest quarterly gross margins since 2018, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said in a Jan. 7 preview. TSMC shares are up more than 4% this month and touched an intraday high Tuesday.\u201cMany of TSMC\u2019s customers such as Huawei, Qualcomm and Mediatek are quickening their pace of adopting cutting-edge processes to prepare for the launch of 5G mobile devices,\u201d Shum said in the report. Rival Samsung Electronics Co. releases its final results Jan. 30. Preliminary figures announced earlier this month showed quarterly earnings beat estimates as global chip prices have shown signs of escaping a protracted slump. The two chipmaking behemoths are the No. 3 and 4 largest stocks in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index and also key contributors to the growing influence of technology names in the gauge. The industry now accounts for almost 15% of the regional gauge, up from 12% at the start of 2019. Internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have the highest weightings in the index. Managers of emerging-market stocks have increased their exposure to semiconductor shares to a record 7.3%, making of it the largest overweight by sector, according to Steven Holden, an analyst at Smartkarma Holdings Pte. Taiwan and South Korean equity overweights also hit a peak, with TSMC among the most favorite companies, it said. Despite all the positives, one potential question mark for TSMC remains Huawei Technologies Co. Tighter export restrictions on the Chinese company by the U.S. would make some of TSMC\u2019s technologies unshippable to Huawei, analysts led by Mark Li at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a Jan. 8 note. While the actual impact on revenue is expected to be in the low single digits and TSMC will be able to pivot to other customers, a short-term impact is \u201cinevitable as share shifts and supply-chain realignment take time.\u201d But overall, the outlook for the semiconductor industry is positive on growth drivers including new 5G technology adoption, internet of things momentum, robust data center demand and even new game console launches, Credit Suisse analysts Randy Abrams and Haas Liu said in a Jan. 13 report.\u201cStocks are recovering from the prior decade\u2019s de-rating and returning to pre-crisis valuations that can sustain,\u201d the analysts said. The main risk? With higher valuations after a strong 2019 rally, any disappointment from product cycle ramps or macro shocks could lead to potential short-term pullbacks, they added.

    "text": "A senior judge with the British Columbia Supreme Court has denied a media request to broadcast the extradition hearing of a Huawei executive wanted in the United States on fraud charges. A consortium of 13 Canadian and international media outlets applied to use two discrete cameras to record portions of Meng Wanzhou's extradition hearing next week. The media's lawyer, Daniel Coles, argued that there is significant public interest in the case and that broadcasting proceedings would engage with the very meaning of open and accessible justice in the modern era. The case has fractured Canada-China relations and Meng, who denies the allegations, is living in one of her Vancouver homes after being freed on bail. Associate Chief Justice Heather Holmes says in her ruling that she agrees with lawyers for Meng and Canada's attorney general that it could compromise the woman's right to a fair trial in the United States, should she be extradited. In a written decision released Monday, Holmes says broadcasting portions of the trial would put that right \\at serious risk by potentially tainting trial witness testimony and the juror pool.\\\"\"\n"

    "text": "Senior U.S. officials visited London on Monday with a last-ditch plea that Boris Johnson\u2019s government not allow Huawei Technologies Co. to supply equipment for its 5G broadband networks, warning that U.S. intelligence-sharing could be at risk. The delegation, led by Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Pottinger and including officials from the State Department, argued that there was no way the U.K. could mitigate the security risks from such a network, according to a person familiar with the meeting. Britain is currently weighing whether to use Huawei equipment as part of its 5G infrastructure. Supporters argue that the company\u2019s equipment can be used in non-core areas in a way that keeps the network secure. But the U.S. warns that the effects of the leap to 5G technology are so poorly understood that the safest and best solution is to keep the Chinese company out altogether. As some of the gear has already been installed, companies warn that a full ban would delay the roll-out of 5G and cost hundreds of millions of pounds. It would also potentially put into doubt Johnson\u2019s pledge to deliver 5G to most of the country by 2027. U.K. newspapers reported Monday that Pottinger\u2019s team had handed Johnson\u2019s government a \u201cdossier\u201d of evidence against Huawei. But it may not impress. Speaking in September on condition of anonymity, British intelligence officers said that there was nothing the U.S. knew about the company that Britain did not. Andrew Parker, the head of the domestic Security Service MI5, told the Financial Times this month that he had \u201cno reason\u201d to believe intelligence-sharing with the U.S. would be harmed by a decision to allow Huawei in. Johnson\u2019s office didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told reporters earlier only that a decision would come \u201cin due course.\u201d The U.S. believes that with the general election out of the way, it is imminent. The road to a U.K. decision has been long and controversial. Some officials have pushed for tough restrictions as a result of concerns over foreign involvement in critical national infrastructure, while others said this would saddle the telecommunications industry with extra costs and delay technological upgrades. Huawei has become a lightning rod for tensions between the U.S. and Europe over trade and security policy as Washington threatens reprisals against any governments that allow Chinese equipment to form part of the crucial ultra-fast networks. Of the so-called Five-Eyes intelligence-sharing nations, New Zealand, Australia and the U.S. have effectively banned the company while Canada and U.K. have not so-far followed suit.\n"

    "text": "OTTAWA -- The CEO of Maple Leaf Foods, Michael McCain, called on parliamentarians to back off on calling for sanctions for Chinese officials last month, according to a copy of a letter obtained by CTV News. The letter, which was obtained by Evan Solomon, host of CTV\u2019s Power Play, was sent last month from McCain to Senators Leo Housakos and Than Hai Ngo. It was in reference to a motion introduced in the Senate by the pair that called for Magnitsky Act sanctions for human rights abuses against Chinese and Hong Kong government officials in relation to the ongoing protests and treatment of Muslims in China.\u201cOn behalf of Maple Leaf Foods and the entire Canadian livestock and meat industry I appeal to you to withdraw this initiative. In making this request, I am not making any judgment on the issue of human rights abuses in Hong Kong or in China. But the simple fact is that Canada acting alone on this ensures two certain consequences: (i) Chinese human rights policies will not change and (ii) Chinese retaliation will be uniquely directed to Canada,\u201d McCain wrote. Going on to cite his industry\u2019s dependence on exports and the jobs potentially at stake, McCain referenced comments from China\u2019s ambassador to Canada stating that sanctions would result in further trade retaliation. While Maple Leaf turned a profit in its most recent quarter, McCain cited global trade as a drag on the company's performance. Canadian beef and pork producers were shut out of the Chinese market for months last year after the country halted imports, a byproduct of in what remains ongoing strained relations between Canada and China over the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver more than a year ago.\u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that there are thousands of livelihoods at risk if your motion triggers action by the government,\u201d reads the letter. Copies of the letter were also sent to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, Foreign Affairs Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, outgoing Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, Agriculture and Agri-Food minister Marie-Claude Bibeau, and Senator Don Plett. The motion has not yet been voted on in the Senate, and while it\u2019s common for industry representatives to send similar letters advocating for or against parliamentary measures, Housakos tweeted about the letter today, questioning McCain\u2019s \u201cconsistency.\u201d Referencing the letter, Housakos said that McCain \u201ccited concern for his employees, ie the impact on their jobs. He didn\u2019t seem overly concerned about human rights then and he didn\u2019t seem overly concerned about his employees and their jobs last night.\u201d This comes after Sunday night when, in a series of tweets posted to his company\u2019s main account, McCain spoke out against the U.S. government and President Donald Trump in relation to the Iranian plane crash. In the thread of what he called \u201cpersonal reflections,\u201d he said he was \u201clivid\u201d because a colleague\u2019s wife and child were two of the 57 Canadians killed when Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752, on Jan. 8 in Tehran. The plane was downed accidentally according to Iran, as they prepared for retaliation for filing missiles as Iraq bases housing U.S. military. McCain called it a \u201cneedless, irresponsible series of events,\u201d and called Trump a \u201cnarcissist,\u201d and alleged that U.S. officials \u201cconcocted an ill-conceived plan to divert focus from political woes.\u201d In a statement, Housakos said that while he sympathizes with the \u201cenormous loss being felt by Mr. McCain\u2019s colleague\u201d and \u201cshares Mr. McCain\u2019s anger over the atrocity that was committed against everyone on that flight and those they left behind,\u201d he believes there have been \u201cvalid\u201d points raised about the appropriateness of McCain\u2019s comments.\n"

    "text": "Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei has a foot in the door of Canadian scientific research as well as international nuclear physics research, documents obtained under access to information show. And, said a Calgary-based China expert, Canada\u2019s intelligence services need to more closely examine deals with the company. The Canadian entry comes via an agreement to provide computer hardware and software to Cloud Compute Canada (CCC). The organization provides national advanced research computing integrating resources from four regional partners: ACENET in Atlantic Canada, Calcul Qu\u00e9bec, Compute Ontario and WestGrid in Western Canada. Under an uncosted deal inked in February 2017, Huawei has provided the hardware and software for CCC. The arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver International Airport in December 2018 has put a spotlight on the company globally. She was arrested due to a U.S. extradition request. The U.S. has alleged Huawei, under direction from Meng and other high-ranking company officials, sold telecom technology to Iran, via unofficial subsidiary SkyCom, in contravention to a 2009-14 sanction imposed by the United States. Meng has denied the allegations. The apprehension in China of two Canadians and the sentencing of a third to death for drug smuggling are widely believed to be retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest. Cloud Compute Canada The lead institution on the CCC agreement is Burnaby\u2019s Simon Fraser University (SFU). CCC regional partners comprise 34 institutions including SFU, the University of Toronto, the University of Victoria and Ontario\u2019s University of Waterloo. And that, said McCuaig-Johnston, is a concern. Indeed, she suggested the federal Communications Security Establishment, whose mandate includes protecting information of national interest, should be examining the CCC situation. Part of the agreement includes providing software patches and a help desk through which Huawei engineers can track faults in real time. McCuaig-Johnston said back doors into computing systems are how companies manage updates or fix equipment.\u201cIt\u2019s through back doors that there\u2019s concerns about hacking into anybody\u2019s information,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s also concerns about companies putting bugs into systems and covering them up so they can\u2019t be found.\u201d Spokeswoman Angela Wilson said SFU \u201ctakes computing security very seriously,\u201d and the contract was part of a public tendering process. The winning bidder was Huawei's Canadian subsidiary. Huawei was selected after a rigorous procurement process.\u201cWe regularly work with the federal government, including the Canadian Security Establishment, to evaluate risks before making purchases of this type. In this case, SFU met with Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada and the Communications Security Establishment before purchasing this Huawei equipment,\u201c Wilson said. \u201cAfter procurement, Compute Canada worked with various partners to secure the network, including with the federal government.\u201d Particle accelerators CCC\u2019s website notes Canada's TRIUMF particle accelerator at Vancouver\u2019s University of British Columbia uses the CCC system for moving research data. Some of that data involves the Atlas major particle physics experiment at the Switzerland-based European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) Large Hadron Collider, the world\u2019s most powerful particle accelerator, used for nuclear science research. It is not involved in nuclear energy or weapons research, although U.S. government information said it could be used for laser development \u201cof direct interest to security and defense applications, including the navy\u2019s proposed application of free-electron laser technology to shipboard defense.\u201d CERN has 23 member states, mainly in Europe. Japan, the Russian Federation, the United States, the European Union, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization have observer status. Canada and China are among 35 non-member states with cooperation agreements and a further 18 states have scientific contacts with CERN. More than 600 institutes and universities worldwide use CERN\u2019s facilities. Senior press officer Sophie Thesauri said CERN works continually on threat assessments.\u201cCERN is an international research organisation that relies on internationally provided large-scale computing services,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cCERN is continuously assessing potential threats to the computer security of its IT systems, has several layers of protective means in place to ensure high-level cybersecurity and acts in a coordinated way with all relevant international partners.\u201d TRIUMF spokesman Stuart Shepherd said the facility \u201csupports and enables international research cooperation and takes seriously threats to data security. We work with our partners, which in this case include CERN, SFU, and others, to address and manage such risks.\u201d TRIUMF itself signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese Guangdong Donlim Kitchen Group. A Bloomberg company profile said that company manufactures toasters, electric kettles, electric pressure cookers and coffee machines, and operates real estate development, leasing and other businesses. Spokesman Stuart Shepherd said TRIUMF does not publicly release agreements, adding the memorandum expired in 2013 with no projects initiated during the 5-year period. Attempts to access the company website were blocked due to computer malware concerns. Its mail server is blacklisted, possibly due to spam blasts. Intelligence gathering McCuaig-Johnston said Huawei is only owned one 1% by CEO Ren Zhengfei, Meng\u2019s father. The other 99%, she said, is owned by trade union committees run by the Communist Party of China. Further, she stressed, Chinese intelligence law mandates that anyone asked to collect intelligence for Beijing must do so. That fact no one has heard reports of any such events flows from another part of the same law saying any such requests and activity must remain secret, she said.\u201cThe fact that they\u2019re doing that second part is covering it up,\u201d she said. On January 4, China\u2019s ambassador to the U.K. countered on Twitter concerns about Huawei supplying intelligence to Beijing.\u201cChina has never and will never ask companies or individuals to collect data, information or intelligence in others countries by illegal means,\u201d Liu Xiaoming tweeted. \u201cFabricating \u2018Huawei risk\u2019 in the name of national security is tantamount to giving a dog a bad name to hang him.\u201d Universities\u2019 involvement with Huawei stands in contrast to bans by countries in the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance sharing information on global crime, espionage and terrorism. Only Canada and the U.K. have not barred use of Huawei equipment for next-generation mobile networks. Australia, New Zealand and the United States barred cooperation with Huawei on next-generation communications technology such as 5G, citing national security concerns. The Communications Security Establishment is the federal body that would advise Ottawa on Huawei\u2019s involvement in 5G. McCuaig-Johnston said Canada\u2019s Nortel \u201cwould be in 5G if it was still alive.\u201d It has long been suggested that Chinese hackers, starting in 2000, downloaded research and development reports, business plans, employee emails and other company documents. Nortel filed for bankruptcy in 2009.\u201cCould there be a link between the Nortel breaches and the rising fortunes of Nortel\u2019s main China-based competitors, Huawei and ZTE?\u201d asked a paper from a 2013 conference of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and Canada\u2019s Department of National Defence. @Jhainswo\n"

    "text": "Canadian taxpayers are funding university research with technical reports, samples, models and prototypes created given to Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. The granting of rights to the controversial company results from agreements under which Canadian universities receive millions in funding from the Shenzhen, China-based Huawei. It\u2019s not unusual for corporate funders to reap the benefits of research, but it raises eyebrows in Huawei\u2019s case due to national security, political and communications ramifications involving Canada and other western countries. Canada\u2019s relationship with Beijing has been strained for more than a year since the December 2018 arrest of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou at Vancouver International Airport on a U.S. extradition request. It is alleged that Huawei, under direction from Meng and other high-ranking company officials, sold telecom technology to Iran via unofficial subsidiary Skycom, in contravention of a 2009-14 sanction imposed by the United States. Meng has denied the allegations. Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested in China days later under Chinese national security laws in a move widely considered to be retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest. The subsequent focus on Huawei intensified following revelations that several Canadian universities \u2013 including two in B.C. \u2013 have been accepting money from Huawei, despite repeated warnings about Chinese companies\u2019 possible involvement in state-sponsored espionage. A Glacier Media investigation shows multiple Canadian research institutions have spent millions with Huawei for computing services. However, sleeping in a bed between its two elephant trading giants, Ottawa has not cautioned universities against working with Huawei. The money The University of British Columbia (UBC), the University of Toronto and Simon Fraser University (SFU) accepted millions from Huawei or spent millions with the company. Senior UBC officials visited Huawei\u2019s Chinese headquarters before accepting up to $3 million in investment from the company interested in the university\u2019s research in big data and fuel cell technology. The deal was sealed October 12, 2017, with UBC president Santa Ono and Huawei Canada Research president Christian Chua signing. The research is through UBC\u2019s faculties of science and engineering, according to documents obtained through access to information legislation. UBC officials also suggested Huawei would be interested in biomedical facilities. The funding contract between Huawei and UBC notes that co-operation would \u201cexpose Huawei to university researchers with core-adjacent fields such as mechanical engineering, advanced manufacturing, materials engineering, chemical and biological engineering, biomedical engineering, design and applied mechanics and theoretical and applied physics.\u201d UBC Industry Liaison Office managing director John-Paul Heale said in an emailed statement that the agreement contains \u201cstandard clauses used in agreements of this kind and are not exclusive to Huawei.\u201d In December 2018, UBC vice-president of research and innovation Gail Murphy said the university \u201cis not aware of any restrictions regarding working with Huawei and will continue with its partnership with Huawei.\u201d And, the agreement says, Canadian federal and provincial government and/or non-governmental grants will be used when possible to maximize scope of research. Specifically named are Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada grants (NSERC). Further funding might come through NSERC industrial research chairs intended to create collaborations between Canadian universities and private and public sector partners.\u201cThe company benefitted from the government funding via NSERC,\u201d said Margaret McCuaig-Johnston, a senior fellow with the China Institute at the University of Alberta. And, the former NSERC executive director said, at least one university has gone back and tweaked its arrangement.\u201cThey took a second look and made changes so there would be more compensation to the university and back to the researchers,\u201d McCuaig-Johnston said.\u201cNational interest is key in this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can any longer look at Huawei as we can at any other company.\u201d However, explained Aiyaz Alibhai, an intellectual property lawyer and engineer with Vancouver\u2019s Miller Thompson office, the pursuit of governmental grants for research is common.\u201cThe Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council funds research and collaboration agreements with universities. All such agreements must comply with the intellectual property policies established by the NSERC for managing and sharing of IP and engagement with industry partners,\u201d Alibhai said. Some of Huawei\u2019s funding to UBC is targeted to \u201cbroaden the awareness of Huawei research priorities to the university\u2019s professors and expose new areas of academic expertise to Huawei as possible research projects.\u201d While intellectual property (IP) rights are to be determined on a project-by-project basis, Huawei would receive such deliverables as technical reports, technical samples, models, specifications, prototypes and samples. Alibhai pointed to NSERC policies that said IP from research projects can be owned by any one, or combination, of the parties involved in and or supporting the research, depending on the policies of the academic institutions and or research agreements in place. Those could include open dissemination with no restrictions, non-exclusive licensing, exclusive licensing, joint ownership, partial assignment of ownership, or full assignment of ownership. Huawei was responsible for paying applicable taxes to Canada Revenue Agency. Huawei could then claim federal input tax credits. The University of Toronto signed a bilateral strategic partnership agreement with Huawei in September 2018. University vice-president for research and innovation Prof. Vivek Goel and Huawei\u2019s Central Research Institute president Jun Zha signed the $3.5 million deal. The university would not release the agreement without an access to information request being made.\u201cThis allows the university to review the documents for any content that may be personal or proprietary and to formally notify the other parties of the agreement so they can also identify concerns about competitive information or other matters,\u201d a university media relations department statement said. Warning bells However, warning bells about dealing with Chinese high-tech companies have been ringing on the university issue for some time. In a report prepared by academics and released by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service in 2018, it was reported that China uses commercial endeavours to advance regime goals.\u201cWhether a Chinese partner company is a state-owned enterprise of a private one, it will have close and increasingly explicit ties to the (Chinese Communist Party),\u201d the report said.\u201cUnless trade agreements are carefully vetted for national security implications, Beijing will use its commercial position to gain access to businesses, technologies and infrastructure that can be exploited for intelligence objectives, or to potentially compromise a partner\u2019s security.\u201d Indeed, Huawei has been specifically mentioned in one report. China\u2019s ambassador to the UK, January 4 countered such concerns about Huawei supplying intelligence to Beijing on Twitter.\u201cChina has never and will never ask companies or individuals to collect data, information or intelligence in others countries by illegal means,\u201d Liu Xiaoming tweeted. \u201cFabricating \u2018Huawei risk\u2019 in the name of national security is tantamount to giving a dog a bad name to hang him.\u201d Other countries Canada is not the only country in which Huawei has made university investments. It has collaborated with U.K. universities including Cambridge, Edinburgh, York, Cardiff, Imperial College London and Manchester. A year ago, however, Oxford University suspended new sponsorships and donations from the company.\u201cThe decision has been taken in the light of public concerns raised in recent months surrounding UK partnerships with Huawei,\u201d the BBC reported the university as saying. Huawei did not respond to a request for comment. @Jhainswo\n"

If you think it is bad now, just watch what Carney will do! In June the federal Conservatives will pick a new leader. While most Conservatives still seem to believe they\u2019ll be picking a candidate to take on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the next election, the odds of that appear to be diminishing by the day. Since being reduced to a minority government in the October 21 election, Mr. Trudeau appears to have lost whatever fire he had in his belly for governing. Since the election, he has essentially ceded all the tedious work of government on major matters to Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland. Departing Bank of England Governor MARK CARNEY If Mr. Trudeau\u2019s new beard demonstrates anything, it is that his ability to command the world\u2019s attention is vastly diminished. He has gone from global rock star to pop-culture has-been and many would say rightfully so. The early signs are not promising that this Prime Minister has a credible second act in him. Trudeau was never a policy wonk. Now, however, he appears to have grown tired of politics. The country is dangerously divided. Perhaps he has concluded that he cannot do much about that. He has shown none of the passion of a Prime Minister determined to reconquer the hearts of Canadians, one selfie at a time, during a second term. Meanwhile, there are a slew of tough and critical files on his desk that he must be dreading. For starters, he must decide whether to approve Teck Resource\u2019s Frontier oil-sands project and whether to ban Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei from Canadian 5G networks. Then he must deal with the Iran plane crash issues in a balanced way without irritating Canadians, President Trump and other stakeholders. There will be no easy way to spin any of those decisions and he will be constantly under the microscope from all sides. But for interested, experienced, capable and effective leaders, that\u2019s what governing is all about. Prescient Liberals are already talking about Mr. Trudeau\u2019s replacement, with one name above all others on their lips \u2013 and no, it\u2019s not Ms. Freeland\u2019s.

Joly stopped by P.E.I. from Jan. 10 to 11 and said ACOA is considered the gold standard by some of Canada\u2019s other agencies, partly because it\u2019s more present and engaged on the ground level.\u201cThe rest of the country looks (to) ACOA.\u201d However, Joly acknowledged growth was minimal for ACOA during the 2010s. This may have been due to the series of cuts it underwent under the decade\u2019s previous government, as well as a low amount of investments, she said. Under the Trudeau government, ACOA\u2019s Immigration Pilot Program was put together, as well as the Atlantic Growth Strategy, in affiliation with Atlantic Canada\u2019s premiers. Making more even investments across Atlantic Canada\u2019s key businesses is one of the goals moving forward, Joly said. One criticism has been the decision to compile all regional agencies under one MP\u2019s jurisdiction. The result is that an MP from outside Atlantic Canada has been tasked to oversee its economic growth, as opposed to local MP\u2019s looking after the regions they\u2019re already familiar with. Joly said this decision was to ensure there\u2019s a more equal distribution of funding across the provinces, and partly to prevent the possibility of a local MP prioritizing their own riding\u2019s growth.\u201cThe idea is to make it non-partisan and fair,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you make sure people have access to equal opportunities?\u201d One of the obvious risks ACOA faces is loaning taxpayer money. Joly said this it just the nature of their job, and they\u2019ve received positive feedback on their funding process, with records showing they\u2019re helping to create jobs. But there\u2019s always room to improve the system by making it more efficient, she said.\u201cObviously, this is taxpayers' money, so we want to make sure that we do it right.\u201d Joly has visited P.E.I. about eight times and expects to be visiting Atlantic Canada quite often, thanks to her new role in cabinet. She admires Islanders for their record of innovation and entrepreneurship, she said.\u201cIslanders are keen at creating good opportunities.\u201d Steady growth ACOA continuing to help boost international business on P.E.I. P.E.I. business has seen steady growth in international markets, MP M\u00e9lanie Joly said. During her visit to the Island from Jan. 10 to 11, the minister of economic development and official languages was scheduled to visit P.E.I. Mussel King in Morell. In 2019, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (ACOA) approved the seafood company for a $500,000 repayable loan, she said.\u201cTo make sure that they could continue to expand on their projects.\u201d Many of P.E.I.\u2019s growing industries rely heavily on exporting goods, with the seafood industry being a clear example. About 80 per cent of all the mussels in the market are coming from P.E.I., she said.\u201c(So) we need to have strong business to really benefit from what the market can offer.\u201d Over the past few years, the P.E.I. government has taken measures to boost international business, namely with China, where Island seafood is in demand.\u201cWe believe the demand will continue to be strong, particularly from South Korea and Asia,\u201d she said. While there have been political tensions between Canada and China in the past few years, such as with the Huawei security scandal, it\u2019s in ACOA\u2019s interest to continue fostering a healthy business relationship with China so that both countries can grow.\u201cWe want to make sure we have strong commercial ties,\u201d Joly said.

    "text": "After three years of tweets and tariffs, President Donald Trump has arrived at his China moment. The phase one deal to be signed Wednesday is expected to include China\u2019s commitments to respect American intellectual property and not manipulate its currency. U.S. officials also anticipate US$200 billion in new purchases that should help reduce a yawning trade deficit and repair some of the damage suffered by farmers. It hands Trump at least a partial agreement many skeptics doubted was ever possible. But even that political victory leaves Trump confronting the same China conundrum that has plagued his predecessors. The broad and bipartisan agreement in Washington is that American presidents have for decades been hoodwinked by a China that has often failed to deliver on its promises. Trump and his lieutenants, of course, insist that this time is different, that experts who see phase one as a rebranding of old guarantees are wrong. Unlike agreements negotiated by prior administrations, this one is enforceable, they say, and there will be real and immediate economic repercussions for China if it comes up short.\u201cWe think it was a good negotiation, we think it will make a real difference,\u201d U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told reporters on Dec. 13. \u201cA skeptic would say \u2018we\u2019ll see\u2019 and that\u2019s probably a wise position to take. But our expectation is that they keep their obligations and in any event, they\u2019re enforceable.\u201d Also, it\u2019s not the end of the story, the White House says. Coming soon, though even Trump acknowledges probably not before the November U.S. presidential election, is a second deal that will address long-standing American complaints not covered in the initial 86-page document. Among those: the state subsidies -- from discounted loans to cheap electricity -- that have nurtured a growing club of Chinese multinationals. Some inside and close to the White House have their own doubts that second installment will ever materialize. Yet the more immediate question is whether China will even live up to the promises in the first phase. And if not, the question becomes whether Trump will have the political courage to take action ahead of the election, even it if risks roiling the markets on which he is hanging his economic credentials.\u201cThere is a real enforcement provision,\u201d U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday on Fox News. \u201cAnd if they don\u2019t comply with the agreement, the president retains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing tariffs and additional tariffs.\u201d In a talking points memo distributed to supporters last month, the administration said it called for each country to establish a special office to monitor the deal\u2019s implementation and address any disputes. If conflicts aren\u2019t resolved within 90 days, the U.S. could take unspecified \u201cproportionate\u201d action against China and vice versa. Either party could also abandon the deal, of course. But some analysts say such a framework risks being inherently political. Wendy Cutler, a veteran trade negotiator now at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says that by not deferring to independent panels or arbitrators, the dispute mechanism leaves the question of violations -- and how to respond -- in the eye of the beholder. That means politics and competing economic pressures and interests are likely to intrude, as they have before. It also means that the only arbiter of whether the Chinese are keeping their end of the bargain will be the Trump administration, which may be loath toadmit they are not.\u201cWhat does it say for one of his key negotiating accomplishments if the president has to admit the agreement isn\u2019t working as intended?\u201d Cutler says. The Hawkish Camp Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist, says there won\u2019t be enough time before November for the president to take action if China doesn\u2019t abide by the deal\u2019s terms. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to ascertain whether they lived up to the commitments until after the 2020 election,\u201d he said. Bannon, who since leaving the administration in 2017 has made hawkishness on China a central part of his brand, says hardliners like him who see communist China as an existential threat to America remain disappointed by a phase one deal they see as easing the pressure on Beijing. A second phase will only be possible if China is put under \u201cextreme duress\u201d by an economic assault on multiple fronts, including restrictions on access to U.S. capital markets, he told Bloomberg News. More moderate observers have their doubts as well. Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, says there are signs already that China and particularly its own economic nationalists have been emboldened by the phase one deal and are shrugging off the commitments it includes.\u201cThere\u2019s a darn good chance we just see a repeat of this show which has been going on certainly since WTO accession in 2001 of China doing what it can to get its tiptoes right up to the letter of the law but in fundamental ways ignoring the spirit of it,\u201d Blanchette says. That is in part because everything from Trump\u2019s impeachment to the looming election and even the president\u2019s handling of Iran is adding to China\u2019s perception of weakness rather than strength in Washington.\u201cThey smell blood for Trump,\u201d Blanchette says. \u201cThere has always been, especially since impeachment, a narrative in China that we\u2019ve got him where we want him, we\u2019ve got a lot more leverage over him than we had.\u201d Rod Hunter, who agonized over China policy while on President George W. Bush\u2019s National Security Council and is now a partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, argues that no single agreement can bridge the huge \u201casymmetry of interests\u201d between the U.S. and China over key issues like the heavy role of the state in the Chinese economy.\u201cWe see that as a problem. But the Chinese government sees that as a feature, a virtue of their system,\u201d Hunter says.\u2018Steady Strides\u2019 For its part, Beijing is pointing to progress. A foreign investment law that took effect Jan. 1 bans administrative agencies from forcing technology transfers. The government also brought forward plans to allow full foreign ownership of life insurers, futures, securities and mutual fund companies by 2020, after cracking the door open in 2018. And while the U.S. labeled China as a \u201ccurrency manipulator\u201d in August at the height of trade war, the People\u2019s Bank of China has long relinquished direct intervention.\u201cChina has made steady strides in reform and opening-up over the past year,\u201d Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., said last week at a gala in New York for Chinese companies that invest in the U.S. Bridging the differences requires a careful balance of diplomacy and leverage.

Hunter and others acknowledge that even if China does not comply with the terms of the phase one deal, Trump has still managed to reset the relationship in ways other than the notable redirection of global supply chains and a reduction in Chinese imports, which is why there is so much talk in policy circles of a decoupling or a new Cold War. Technology Battles The administration has enforced a new, broader conception of national security and given defense and intelligence officials a bigger say in economic policy, particularly on China. In practical terms that has meant stricter curbs on Chinese investment in the U.S. and on the ability of American technology companies to do business with China, as seen most vividly in the blacklisting last year of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies Co. Those efforts aren\u2019t ending with the new truce. In fact, they are expanding. In the pipeline is a new Commerce Department rule to restrict U.S. imports of telecommunications equipment -- such as that made by Huawei -- that might threaten U.S. national security. Tariffs, meanwhile, will remain a blunt stick.

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., a major chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co., has recruited rival Intel Corp.\u2019s former top lobbyist Peter Cleveland to spearhead an unprecedented effort in Washington to mitigate impact from U.S.-Chinese trade tensions. The world\u2019s biggest contract chipmaker joins a growing number of companies with Chinese business interests that are stepping up U.S. lobbying, aiming to gauge and lessen the fallout from Washington\u2019s ongoing dispute with Beijing. The Taiwanese company indicated in July it was considering starting government relations operations in the U.S. Cleveland, who headed Intel\u2019s lobbying effort for over a decade, updated his LinkedIn profile this month to reflect new responsibilities including representing TSMC on policy, legislative and regulatory matters. There\u2019s been speculation U.S. sanctions may affect TSMC\u2019s shipments to Huawei. But the Taiwanese chipmaker has publicly quashed talk of U.S. pressure for it to stop supplying its No. 2 customer, which Washington blacklisted and views as a national security threat. Read more: TSMC to Keep Supplying Huawei, Quashes Talk of U.S. Pressure\u201cPeter Cleveland is helping TSMC enhance communications with stakeholders including government officials at a global level,\u201d TSMC spokeswoman Nina Kao told Bloomberg News by phone, adding Cleveland is based in Washington D.C. While there have been TSMC staffers tasked with similar responsibilities previously, Cleveland\u2019s arrival coalesces the effort under one independent position, according to Kao. TSMC plays an indispensable role in the global semiconductor industry, commanding more than 50% of the global foundry market. U.S. and Chinese tech companies from Advanced Micro Devices Inc. to Nvidia Corp. rely on it for the production of their most advanced chips. It joins a wave of companies that in recent months have begun to play a more active role in lobbying Washington. Huawei spent a company-record $1.8 million on federal lobbying in the past quarter as it struggled against U.S. sanctions that deprived it of key components or software from American suppliers like Intel, Xilinx Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. TikTok, the popular music-video app owned by Beijing-based ByteDance Inc., is also expanding its U.S. lobbying operations. Huawei is TSMC\u2019s largest customer after Apple, according to Bloomberg supply chain data, contributing roughly 10% of the chipmaker\u2019s revenue. Cleveland managed 200 attorneys and policy professionals while at Intel, and his areas of expertise include antitrust reviews, 5G spectrum allocations, and global IP enforcement and protection, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before Intel, he served as California Senator Dianne Feinstein\u2019s chief of staff. Read more: Trump\u2019s Blacklisting of Huawei Is Failing to Halt Its Growth --With assistance from Ian King.

    "text": "As Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou prepares for the first phase of her extradition hearing, Canada is still trying to decide if the Chinese telecom company should be part of this country's 5G network. But is it possible to make that decision without considering the fate of the two Canadians jailed in China following Meng's arrest? Or the overall dismal state of China-Canada relations? Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, both of whom were living in China, were arrested and accused of spying within a week of Meng's arrest in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition warrant for fraud. In the year since, China has taken aim at imports of Canadian canola and meat. Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei \u2014 who is also Meng's father \u2014 has done his best to keep his company above the fray of geopolitics, citing both a faith in the Canadian rule of law and a belief that there's no connection between the arrests of Kovrig, Spavor and his daughter. But with Meng about to step back into the spotlight and the decision on 5G still looming, it may prove hard to disentangle the cases. University of Ottawa professor Wesley Wark says both the Canadian government and Huawei face a challenge in terms of the extent to which the variety of issues swirling around the company will shape public perception. \\The government has to find a way to say, 'We are going to deal with the Huawei 5G case in its own dimension, in its own right, and we are not going to use it as a tool of leverage or a tool of counterstrike against China itself,\\\" said Wark, a national security and intelligence expert. Accused of lying to banks Meng, who is Huawei's chief financial officer, will appear in court starting Jan. 20 for a week-long hearing marking the first stage of the extradition process. Her court appearances to date have been for pretrial motions and attempts to get bail. The 47-year-old is accused of lying to banks about Huawei's connection to a subsidiary accused of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran \u2014 in turn placing Meng's financiers at risk of breaking American law. The upcoming hearing concerns the issue of double criminality and whether the offence Meng is charged with in the U.S. would be considered a crime in Canada. Her lawyers plan to argue that since Canada doesn't have the same sanctions against Iran, Meng's actions could not have led to any breach. The Crown will argue that fraud is fraud on both sides of the border, and that even Canadian banks are subject to American laws when money passes through the U.S. financial system. Meng has denied the allegations and has declined to be interviewed in person. Her father, on the other hand, has invited a steady stream of journalists to the company's headquarters in Shenzhen to counter U.S. claims that Huawei is a Trojan horse for the Chinese government and can't be trusted to build Western 5G networks. Australia and Japan have also blocked Huawei while Germany and the U.K have yet to make a decision on the company's participation in their 5G projects. A decision from Canada is expected soon. The government has said little about its deliberations but has promised that the main goal is to ensure that networks are kept secure. The CBC had accepted an invitation from Huawei to travel to China to meet with Ren in early January, but the interview was cancelled on the advice of Meng's lawyers. Canada 'of symbolic importance' The cancellation followed Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's appearance on the Quebec television show Salut Bonjour, where he said he had urged the U.S. not to sign a trade deal with China without settling \\\"the question of Meng Wanzhou and the two Canadians.\\\" Kovrig and Spavor have been held in jail for more than a year, denied access to lawyers and family, but allowed one consular visit from Canadian diplomats per month. U.S. President Donald Trump has said that he will sign the first phase of a deal expected to reduce tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. goods on Jan. 15. The U.S. launched a trade war against Beijing in 2018 over allegations of unfair trade practices. The fight has seen both nations place tariffs on billions of dollars worth of goods. Prof. Paul Evans, with the University of British Columbia's School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, says Canadians should separate \\\"emotionally and politically\\\" the three different aspects of Huawei's involvement in Canada: Meng Wanzhou's arrest\n"

    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - A delegation of U.S. officials will arrive in Britain on Monday to try to persuade Britain not to use Huawei equipment in the upgrade of its telecoms network, two people with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday. Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei Technologies equipment in its future 5G networks later this month. Security minister Brandon Lewis told the BBC on Sunday a decision would be taken \u201crelatively soon\u201d. The U.S. delegation is expected to include deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, the two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. UK ministers must weigh U.S.-led allegations that the equipment could be used for Chinese state spying against Britain\u2019s relationship with Beijing and industry warnings that banning the firm outright would cost billions of dollars. Huawei, the world\u2019s largest maker of mobile networking equipment, has repeatedly denied that its equipment could be used for spying. A company spokesman has previously said UK lawmakers had confirmed Huawei equipment would not be deployed in networks used for intelligence sharing. One U.S. senator has introduced a bill that would prevent the United States from sharing intelligence with countries that allow Huawei Technologies to operate 5G network technology. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been expected to press British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab over Huawei when the pair met in Washington last week. British defense Minister Ben Wallace told the Sunday Times that U.S. President Donald Trump and his advisers have threatened to cut off some intelligence to the UK if the National Security Council gives Huawei a green light.\u201cIt\u2019s not a secret. They have been consistent. Those things will be taken into account when the government collectively decides to make a decision on it,\u201d Wallace said.\n"

    "text": "On Wednesday, 63 Canadians were innocent victims of the Iranian air disaster, caught in the crossfire of warmongering over the past year. But in the days since, Canada has suffered from disastrous decisions of its own making, boxed in by our undiplomatic manoeuvring of the past eight years. Without a Canadian embassy in place on the ground in Tehran, we have been caught out of position and out of country. Our team of rapid-response diplomats had to cool its heels awaiting visas \u2014 first assembling in Ottawa, then holding in Turkey, awaiting onward connections to Tehran until the paperwork cleared. Had our envoys been in place at the time of the downing, they could have deployed from our embassy directly to the crash site, using every means at their (diplomatic) disposal to protect Canadian interests: First, arranging emergency treatment for any injured had there been any survivors; second, securing the bodies of the dead for transport and burial without delay; third, documenting any evidence pointing to the causes; fourth, demanding on the scene that Canadian national and humanitarian interests be respected in the highly fraught investigation, notably in handling the black box that holds important clues. This isn\u2019t the way other countries have handled Iran, or responded to the deaths. Instead of having a head start on the other side of the world, so crucial to any country\u2019s foreign service, our diplomats were a world away. At a time of national mourning, it might seem beside the point \u2014 or even pointless \u2014 to question why our foreign policy apparatus was missing in action for one of the greatest single Canadian diplomatic and consular challenges of recent years. Amid the grieving, however, our self-imposed isolation from Iran has only exacerbated the suffering of the surviving families in Canada, which surely qualifies it as a foreign policy failure worth figuring out, if only for the future. To be sure, a functioning Canadian embassy in Iran would not have spared the lives of anyone. But a diplomatic presence might have eased the pain of their deaths for the surviving families, not least by hastening the identification and repatriation of bodies. No one could have predicted such a disaster. And yet closing our embassy was an accident waiting to happen, because it was only a matter of time until Canadians would be in need. The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a cauldron for decades, sitting on political flashpoints and geological fault lines \u2014 from the 1979 U.S. embassy hostage crisis to the killing of Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi in 2003, not to mention major earthquakes that can cause untold human casualties at any moment (one of which I covered years ago). We closed our embassy in Tehran with good reason after then-ambassador Ken Taylor put himself in harm\u2019s way by helping to \u201cexfiltrate\u201d American diplomats during the 1979 hostage crisis. But bear in mind that we never severed formal diplomatic relations, nor did we prevent Iranian diplomats from using their embassy in Ottawa in the years that followed. Keeping that formal bilateral channel open helped us reopen our embassy a decade later in Tehran, which in turn opened the door to a flood of talented Iranian immigrants to Canada numbering 300,000 people today. Why then did we close our embassy, and go one step further by also cutting off diplomatic relations in 2012? Stephen Harper\u2019s Conservative government cited a grab-bag of concerns, from human rights violations to its nuclear program and security concerns that politicized the issues. Why didn\u2019t Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government reverse course when he became prime minister? Trudeau told the Star\u2019s editorial board in 2015 that he would re-examine the decision, but he never resumed relations nor reopened the embassy. Michel de Salaberry served as Canada\u2019s ambassador to Iran in the late 1990s when I was based in the Middle East for the Star, and who subsequently returned as charge d\u2019affaires in times of tension. He told me it made sense to close the embassy for a period in 2012 after the British embassy briefly came under attack, but not to sever all diplomatic ties. The British have long since returned, and have maintained formal diplomatic ties. So have other Western countries. De Salaberry believes the embassy should have been reopened long ago, but domestic political considerations constrained Trudeau. The Harper government boxed him in with legislation that permitted potentially enormous lawsuits against Iran \u2014 a roadblock to re-establishing bilateral ties, and a delicate matter for Trudeau to reverse. Make sense of what's happening across the country and around the world with the Star's This Week in Politics email newsletter. Sign Up Now Now we are more isolated than most. Germany and Sweden also suffered casualties in the crash, but their diplomats on the ground were able to move in swiftly to protect consular and humanitarian interests. Others understand that diplomatic relations are never an endorsement of international lawlessness, merely an instrument to protect national interests and defend dual nationals. We cannot afford to cut ourselves off for years at a time, no matter how frustrated. It is a lesson worth remembering when it comes to China \u2014 a country that has effectively taken one of our diplomats hostage and ransomed our farm exports over the Huawei affair. The Iran debacle reminds us that diplomatic relations are not merely for friendly countries in good times, but most especially for difficult countries in bad times.\n"

    "text": "VANCOUVER \u2014 The Department of Justice says the allegations against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou would be a crime in Canada and she should be extradited to the United States on fraud charges. The department says in court documents that the allegations meet the crucial extradition test of \\double criminality,\\\" meaning that if they had occurred in Canada they would be criminal under Canadian law. The U.S. alleges that Meng lied to HSBC about Huawei's relationship with an affiliate that was doing business in Iran, putting the bank at risk of violating U.S. sanctions against the country. Her legal team has argued the alleged misrepresentations do not amount to fraud and says the case is really about the U.S. trying to enforce its sanctions against Iran even though Canada has no such sanctions. Lawyers for the Department of Justice say in the court documents released today that Meng's alleged conduct put the bank at risk of economic loss and is sufficient to make a case of fraud in Canada. The Huawei chief financial officer denies the allegations and is free on bail, living in one of her two multimillion-dollar homes in Vancouver, ahead of a hearing set to begin Jan. 20 that will focus on the double-criminality test. This report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 10, 2020.\"\n"

    "text": "It is a pinch-me, look-at-me-now situation for Mirko Bibic, who woke up his first day on the job with an admitted case of the butterflies MONTREAL \u2014 The ritual was unfailingly consistent for Sunny Handa and his new friend, Mirko Bibic, a fellow Montrealer he met in the registration line at the University of Toronto law school in the fall of 1989. At the time, both were 22, hungry for the world and starving for hockey, specifically, Montreal Canadiens hockey, a hometown team they were devoted to in a hostile, Maple Leafs-loving city. On game nights, the two law buddies would hang out at Bibic\u2019s apartment not far from campus, hitting the books until precisely 6:45 p.m., when the frozen wings and pizza would go into the oven and the quiet, concentrated study of case law would give way to animated discussions of Les Glorieux.\u201cWe were religious about watching the Canadiens games,\u201d Handa recently recalled. \u201cAnd I could never have imagined where it would all end up for Mirko. You knew he was going to be successful, because he was driven to succeed, but to be CEO of the one of the biggest companies in Canada? On the day the news came out, I sent him an email, a WTF-question-mark-email, because, I mean, oh my god.\u201d Bibic, a likeable, working-class bilingual son of immigrant parents, is the new chief executive of BCE Inc., a.k.a. Bell, the monster telecom with 56,000 or so employees \u2014 plus a minority ownership stake in the Montreal Canadiens (Bell also has a stake in the Leafs). It is a pinch-me, look-at-me-now situation for the 52-year-old, who woke up Jan. 6, his first day on the job, with an admitted case of the butterflies. By 2 p.m., however, the jitters had subsided, even if the novelty of the occasion had not. Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below. A Bell employee since 2004, Bibic started the day by meeting his senior executive team at the company\u2019s Montreal headquarters on Nuns\u2019 Island, a short drive from the city centre. Following a boardroom lunch featuring mineral water, a mix of salads and assorted holiday fare, the new boss was spotted, coffee in hand, near a Tim Hortons on the building\u2019s main floor. Two Bell employees approached him, asking to get their pictures taken. Bibic, looking sharp in a blue suit, with a silver Bell pin on the lapel, tossed an arm around each man\u2019s shoulder and grinned.\u201cThat\u2019s the first time that\u2019s ever happened,\u201d he said. \u201cI woke up this morning and it kind of all sunk in. I am from Montreal, and now here I am, and so I definitely had some butterflies, but I\u2019m all good now.\u201d Keeping calm will be a strategic must for Bibic, given the country\u2019s current telecom climate, one in which government regulators and federal politicians are eyeing the Big Three oligopoly (Bell, Rogers Communications Inc. and Telus Corp.) for, well, a serious makeover. Gone, at least in theory, could be the days when running Old Ma Bell meant pumping out profits and competition \u2014 wink, wink \u2014 involved dividing the spoils into thirds. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals want to slash cellphone rates by 25 per cent, or else; the Competition Bureau and Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission are clamouring for greater competition in the wireless sector ; and Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., a Bell supplier, is in limbo as the government weighs whether giving the Chinese behemoth access to the coming 5G revolution would potentially mean giving away too much to Beijing. There are also market disruptors, such as Netflix Inc., Walt Disney Co. and whoever comes next; weary old landline customers cutting their home phone cords; and a young generation that almost exclusively consumes content on their phones. If all that\u2019s not enough to disturb Bibic\u2019s sleep, there is also the legacy of George Cope, his immediate predecessor, to consider. Cope was inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame two years before he left the top job at Bell. His 12-year reign was synonymous with dividends and year-over-year EBITDA growth. His charitable side project, Let\u2019s Talk, was a campaign to raise awareness around mental-health issues that has since transcended the man and the company that started it. To an outsider, the regulatory headaches, market uncertainty, placating shareholders and the big shoes to fill seem a little daunting, though Bibic said it is merely part of the \u201cfun\u201d of running a $55-billion enterprise. Part of what he learned from Cope, he said, was to plan meticulously, try to see around corners and \u201csweat the details,\u201d even the small ones. Unlike Cope, however, the new guy isn\u2019t a telecom lifer, but a lawyer by trade, whose blistering rise from young associate to 36-year-old managing partner at Stikeman Elliott LLP, a blue-chip Bay Street Toronto firm where 36-year-olds don\u2019t make partner, let alone become managing partners, was near the stuff of legend. Bibic could have stayed in Ottawa running, as he was, the firm\u2019s office there, earning big money, weeding through the minutiae of regulatory law and raising his three boys with his wife, Jackie Philippoussis. But Lawson Hunter had other ideas for someone he viewed as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Now a septuagenarian senior counsel at Stikeman, Hunter is largely responsible for drafting the country\u2019s Competition Act. In legal circles, his career is the actual stuff of legend, and his past casework a staple on law school syllabuses. Hunter met Bibic and Paul Collins, another young Stikeman associate, in the early 1990s, affectionately referring to the pair as his \u201cmushrooms,\u201d due to the crap load of work he piled on them.\u201cWith Mirko, it\u2019s obvious that he is smart, hardworking and that he has a great personality,\u201d Hunter said. \u201cHe is the complete package.\u201d Hunter stunned his legal colleagues in 2003 by leaving Stikeman to join Bell as an executive vice-president and chief corporate officer. He stunned them again when he picked up the phone and asked Bibic to join him. Bibic was already thinking about making a jump, he just didn\u2019t know where to until his mentor answered the question for him: senior vice-president, regulatory affairs, Bell.\u201cIt didn\u2019t take me long to say, \u2018This is perfect,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI had done zero telecom work in my career. In fact, I tried to avoid telecom work at Stikeman. It just goes to show you: you have just got to throw yourself into something interesting \u2014 and any challenge can be interesting \u2014 and don\u2019t pigeonhole yourself.\u201d You have just got to throw yourself into something interesting \u2014 and any challenge can be interesting \u2014 and don\u2019t pigeonhole yourself Mirko Bibic Bibic and his fellow mushroom, Collins, have stayed close, and grabbed dinner a few months back at Harbour 60, a pricey steakhouse near the Toronto waterfront featuring porterhouse for $90 a cut. Upon cracking the menu, Bibic, on the cusp of a promotion to a job that paid his predecessor more than $10 million a year, practically gasped. Collins relates the story to make the point that both he and Bibic grew up first-generation Canadians. Neither is from a Toronto or Montreal establishment family, or had a father, grandfather and great-grandfather who all practiced The Law. They turned up at school \u2014 Collins is another U of T law grad \u2014 in ripped jeans and T-shirts, counting every penny as they went, relying on their smarts, talent and a tireless work ethic to get ahead.\u201cNo one handed Mirko anything,\u201d Collins said. Bibic\u2019s first summer job was working construction with his Serbian father, Veljko, a carpenter, on commercial builds around Montreal. His mom, Ginette, an administrator, was born in France. Bibic also did a stint as a janitor at a local hospital. He isn\u2019t afraid to get his hands dirty.\u201cMy parents taught me the importance of education and the importance of having a work ethic,\u201d he said. Hard work got him to where he is now, a top executive, earning 200 times (or so) more than the Bell tech driving around in a repair truck. It is a staggering sum given his roots and although money is a thing, it isn\u2019t The Thing for Bibic.\u201cI am not one to live an ostentatious lifestyle,\u201d he said. His four oldest pals are guys he grew up with in Longueuil, the predominately Francophone city directly across the St. Lawrence River from Montreal. (Bibic spoke French and English at home; his childhood hero was Guy Lafleur). He met his wife when he was still a teenager. When their three boys, now grown, were younger, and Bibic was working maniac hours and travelling a ton, his family title was: Weekend Hockey Tournament Dad. No one handed Mirko anything Paul Collins\u201cI have stayed in every crappy motel in Quebec, Eastern Ontario, Sudbury, Peterborough, Toronto. You name it, I have been there,\u201d he said. \u201cThose were fun years.\u201d Sunday nights around the Bibic home meant mandatory family dinners, and non-hockey season weekends involved going to the family cottage north of Ottawa. It is a phase of life Bibic leaves behind with his new job. He and Jackie have left Ottawa, and are renting condos in Toronto and Montreal, while Bibic splits time between the city he loved in his youth and the city he left immediately after law school.\u201cI am going to have to find a new rhythm,\u201d he said. Part of writing about Mirko Bibic involves the impossible (to date) task of trying to find someone with a bad or even lukewarm word to say about him. There are no obvious enemies, old foes with axes to grind, friends he double-crossed, clients he failed or colleagues he stabbed in the back on the way to the top. By all accounts, Bibic is, as he said, \u201cgrounded,\u201d and he is genuinely well liked, a people-person quality that was evident early on to Sunny Handa, his Habs-loving pal. Law school is cliquey. People jockey for favour and jobs. Some play classroom politics, a potentially fraught environment Bibic skated through, not by pissing people off, but by making people laugh and being honest.\u201cMirko is a no BS guy,\u201d Handa said. \u201cHe always tells you like it is, but not in a mean way, just in a very honest way, and you need to remember he is funny. Mirko sees the humour in life, he loves to laugh, and what is not to like about that?\u201d Being nice doesn\u2019t mean being a pushover. One lawyer familiar with Bibic\u2019s work said he is exactly the person you\u2019d want to have watching your back in a \u201cknife fight.\u201d His instinct is that of a brawler, intellectually, and it comes with a self-confidence underpinned by a gentlemen\u2019s understanding that being a jerk, in either life or business, isn\u2019t particularly productive. Bibic\u2019s personality served him well during his many appearances before the Competition Bureau over the years.\u201cWhen Mirko didn\u2019t succeed on a point, he would be very gracious, but he was tenacious,\u201d said John Pecman, a former bureau commissioner. \u201cHe is tough as nails, and he likes to win, and he is going to be a great advocate for the company, but not at any cost.\u201d For example, later that first day on the job, Bibic\u2019s nose is being powdered by a makeup artist at CBC\u2019s Montreal headquarters in preparation for a taped television segment with Gerald Fillion, a French-language business reporter. He is tough as nails, and he likes to win, and he is going to be a great advocate for the company, but not at any cost John Pecman Bell has 14,000 employees in Quebec, and Bibic views his bilingualism as a distinct advantage. But Fillion wasn\u2019t about to show his fellow Quebecer mercy and asked, as others previously had in both official languages, about the Trudeau pledge to slash 25 per cent off cellphone bills. Bibic\u2019s stock answer, if people were willing to listen to facts, is that the facts are thus: prices are already coming down, and cheaper doesn\u2019t mean better. A race to the bottom price-wise could fundamentally \u201csacrifice\u201d wireless quality and coverage, thus limiting the country\u2019s potential to be at the global \u201cforefront of technology.\u201d It is a great argument and in making it, Bibic surely knows he is paddling against a populist tide. As he put it after the Fillion chat: \u201cEverybody will find their own answer.\u201d Translation: the public is going to believe what it wants to believe, and the public generally believes it is getting screwed by the Big Three, whether they are or not. Outside the CBC studio on the streets of Montreal, as light snow falls, a day that began for Bibic before 6 a.m. wasn\u2019t over yet. He had a hockey game to get to. The Canadiens are in town.

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwanese voters cast ballots Saturday in an election that will determine the future direction of the world\u2019s only Chinese-speaking democracy as it faces pressure to pick sides in a global power struggle between the U.S. and China. President Tsai Ing-wen of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party is seeking a second term in the face of competition from Han Kuo-yu of the main opposition Kuomintang, which has governed for much of the time since World War II, and James Soong of the People First Party. Polls open at 8:00 a.m. and close at 4:00 p.m., with a result expected around 8 p.m. Analysts widely expect a win for Tsai, who attracted large crowds to her rallies in recent months after forcefully backing Hong Kong protests against China\u2019s increasing grip over the city. Han, meanwhile, asked his supporters to lie to pollsters ahead of the vote to discredit election surveys. Taiwanese laws bar publication of opinion polls until 4 p.m. on election day. While issues such as wages, housing and air quality are important to voters, the self-ruled island\u2019s complex relationship with China is the main political fissure in Taiwanese society. A victory for Tsai, whose party advocates formal independence from China, would likely mean four more years of no talks between the two sides on one of the region\u2019s main potential flash points. China, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory, cut off all contact with Tsai\u2019s government after she declined to endorse the \u201cone-China\u201d policy after her inauguration in 2016. Since she took power, Beijing has sought to further isolate Taipei diplomatically by convincing smaller nations in the Pacific, Africa and Central America to switch sides.\u201cWe do not rule out the possibility of discussions, dialogs and meetings between Taiwan and China, but they need to be conducted without preconditions,\u201d Taiwan\u2019s foreign minister Joseph Wu said at a briefing in Taipei Thursday. \u201cIf China wants to speak with Taiwan, they should speak with Taiwan as it is. Taiwan is a democracy.\u201d Despite the freeze on cross-strait ties and the U.S.-China trade war, foreign investors have continued to pour into Taiwan\u2019s markets. Stocks saw their biggest annual gain in a decade last year, leaving the benchmark Taiex index just four percentage points off an all-time high. The presidential election isn\u2019t the only choice facing voters: The battle for control of Taiwan\u2019s top lawmaking body could end up being more consequential in Saturday\u2019s elections. If the electorate returns Tsai to the presidential office but gives the KMT a majority in the legislature, it will likely lead to four years of political acrimony and deadlock. The reverse could also be true. A Japanese colony for the first half of the 20th century, Taiwan came under the control of China\u2019s Nationalist government after World War II. It became a refuge for Chiang Kai-shek and his troops as they fled the Communists at the end of China\u2019s civil war. Under Tsai, Taiwan has aligned itself more closely with the U.S., interrupting eight years of closer ties with China under her predecessor Ma Ying-jeou. At stake in this election is whether Taiwan continues to move closer to the U.S. or reverts to an economic policy focused on opening more to China\u2019s markets, as advocated by Han. While there\u2019s no sense of an open conflict between China and Taiwan, a Tsai victory would likely see Beijing increase efforts to conduct cyberattacks, invest in Taiwan\u2019s media and restrict tourist visas, according to Jonathan Sullivan, director of the University of Nottingham\u2019s China programs.\u201cIn response, Tsai will continue to diversify Taiwan\u2019s economy by looking to Southeast Asia and continue to cultivate close ties with informal allies, especially the U.S. and Japan,\u201d he said. Taiwan\u2019s room to maneuver between the world\u2019s two main economic powers may be diminishing. U.S. efforts to ensure it maintains the technological upper hand by restricting Chinese access to cutting-edge computer chips and components could weigh on the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the island\u2019s largest company. Its two biggest customers are Apple Inc. and Huawei Technologies Co. China, meanwhile, is increasing pressure on Taiwan to enter talks about eventual unification. In a speech directed at the Taiwanese public last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Taiwan\u2019s separation from China could not be allowed to continue from generation to generation. The most recent example of alleged Chinese meddling came on Thursday. Australia\u2019s The Age newspaper reported that a senior KMT member attempted to coerce self-confessed Chinese spy Wang Liqiang, with both threats and financial incentives, to recant claims he had helped organize Chinese efforts to spread disinformation in Taiwan against Tsai. The KMT official involved, Alex Tsai -- no relation to the president -- denied The Age report in a briefing in Taipei on Thursday. He countered that Wang was instead a DPP asset, paid by the ruling party to invent claims of Chinese influence operations against the Taiwanese government. The DPP countered by demanding the KMT explain whether it\u2019s working with the Chinese government. --With assistance from Ryan Edward Chua and Cindy Wang.

    "text": "Bending to demands from Beijing is unwise, Taiwan\u2019s Foreign Minister is warning, days before an extradition hearing begins in Canada for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, whose release China has loudly demanded. The arrest of Ms. Meng in December, 2018, set in motion an escalating diplomatic and economic dispute with China, which has blocked imports of some Canadian goods and arrested two men, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, accusing them of state-secrets violations in what has been widely seen as retaliation. Calls for Ottawa to release Ms. Meng have intensified as the continuing conflict exacts an increasing toll. But seeking to mollify China is risky, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu warned in an interview this week.\u201cTaiwan\u2019s experience is that if we cave in to China\u2019s demands, China would always demand more,\u201d Mr. Wu said, just days before Saturday\u2019s presidential vote, in which his Democratic Progressive Party is seeking re-election. Rather than \u201cappease China,\u201d he said, \u201cthe best way to deal with it is for the like-minded countries to work together in dealing with the situation. Hostage-taking cannot be accepted by modern civilization.\u201d Taiwan occupies a unique position relative to Beijing. It is a self-governing democratic territory, with its own currency and military, that is claimed by China as a renegade province. That has placed Taipei at what Mr. Wu calls the \u201cfront line of China\u2019s authoritarian expansionism.\u201d Taiwan nationals have also been seized by Chinese authorities \u201cwithout any clear evidence of wrongdoing,\u201d he said. The human-rights group Safeguard Defenders has compiled a list of people caught up in what it calls Chinese \u201chostage diplomacy\u201d in recent years. They come from Canada, Taiwan, the U.S., Japan, Australia, Britain and Hong Kong. In Canada, Justice Minister David Lametti can step in at any time to halt extradition proceedings against Ms. Meng, who U.S. prosecutors accuse of fraud related to violations of sanctions against Iran. The extradition hearing for Ms. Meng is scheduled to begin Jan. 20, but Huawei and the Chinese government have called the allegations against her politically motivated. Senior members of the Canadian corporate and political establishment, including former prime minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien, have advocated for Ottawa to release Ms. Meng in hopes of normalizing relations with China. But to do so \u201cwould encourage [China] to use hostage diplomacy more in the future, because it shows that it works,\u201d said Scott Simon, the co-chair in Taiwan Studies at the University of Ottawa. He also warned that it\u2019s unlikely any such move, even if it won the release of the imprisoned Canadians, would return relations with Beijing to normal. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back,\u201d he said, pointing to a Chinese leadership he called recalcitrant and confident. He suggested taking seriously the words of caution from Mr. Wu. Taiwan\u2019s proximity to China means it has \u201ca lot of lessons for us,\u201d he said. Chinese scholars, however, assailed the Taiwanese politician as self-interested and untrustworthy. The Democratic Progressive Party \u201cwill say whatever it can to hurt China\u2019s image on the international stage,\u201d said Zhang Wensheng, deputy director of the Graduate Institute for Taiwan Studies at Xiamen University. \u201cJoseph Wu, by raising Taiwan\u2019s high-level experience in coping with China and issuing warnings to other countries, is making a mistake. It\u2019s as ridiculous as Quebec teaching the rest of the world about its expertise in dealing with Canada.\u201d The notion that \u201cCanada would be seen as weak by listening to China\u2019s words and releasing Ms. Meng is groundless,\u201d he added. \u201cMaintaining good diplomatic relations means you must negotiate, exchange interests and make necessary sacrifices. Mr. Wu made such a warning just to provoke alienation between China and Canada.\u201d Li Zhenguang, deputy director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, accused Canada of equal complicity in politically motivated justice. \u201cIf hostage-taking is unacceptable, why doesn\u2019t Mr. Wu suggest that the Canadian side take the first step and make Ms. Meng free?\u201d he said. It is in Canada\u2019s best interests, he said, to release Ms. Meng.\u201cYou can say that we are seeing heavy rain between the two countries. Sending Ms. Meng back to China will definitely make people see the sunshine again,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if Canada continues to resist taking action, the situation will keep getting uglier.\u201d With reporting by Alexandra Li Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day\u2019s most important headlines.

    "text": "Few cherish the fragility of democracy more than the people of Taiwan. Located perilously close to an adversary seeking to undermine its sovereignty and democracy, Taiwan has developed remarkable resilience to China\u2019s ongoing threats. This resilience will be put to the test on Saturday as voters cast ballots in Taiwan\u2019s national elections. Canada is no stranger to China's bully diplomacy. Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are entering their second year of arbitrary detention in China in response to the legal arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. extradition request. And just last month, Chinese Ambassador Cong Peiwu threatened retaliation if Canada imposed Magnitsky sanctions on Chinese officials who are responsible for human rights abuses. Beijing\u2019s aggressive influence operations within Canada have targeted elected officials at all government levels and riding level political party structures are under increasing threat of being compromised by groups connected to China\u2019s local consulates and the United Front. Platforms such as Facebook and WeChat regularly used by Beijing to spread disinformation about Canada, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Even Canadian corporations operating in China are overtly threatened in Chinese state media if they don\u2019t toe Beijing\u2019s line. Taiwan\u2019s success in resisting China\u2019s influence lies in the fact that they have developed defences against China\u2019s objectives \u2014 namely, aggressive expansionism and the subjugation of smaller nations to Beijing\u2019s direct influence. As such, Taiwan has taken diversified trade, bolstered domestic defence industries, and reinforced democratic institutions to directly address China\u2019s influence and information warfare. This dedication to democracy has been put into action by Taiwanese Minister Audrey Tang, who is Taiwan\u2019s first transgender cabinet minister and among the first anywhere in the world. She has developed an innovative open government policy that allows all citizens to directly contribute to the country\u2019s policy-making process. Tang is also responsible for overseeing the development of Taiwan\u2019s countermeasures against Beijing\u2019s disinformation attacks \u2014 without negatively affecting personal liberties, including freedom of expression. When I recently met with Tang in Taipei, she explained that the Taiwanese government has developed a protocol for \u201cworking toward disarming disinformation that does not involve infringing of journalistic freedom.\u201d Within two hours of detecting a disinformation attack, the relevant Taiwanese ministries are required \u201cto roll out clarification of 200 characters or less and at least two pictures.\u201d Tang says the Taiwanese counter-disinformation system is \u201cnow good enough that most [ministries] can deliver the clarifications within 60 minutes.\u201d This rapid response is designed to defuse the disinformation narrative by getting ahead of it and stopping its spread on social media. Through a unique agreement with Facebook, the company has agreed to adjust its algorithms so disinformation attacks no longer reach user news feeds. \u201cYou have to scroll for two hours to see [the story],\u201d says Tang. \u201cIt\u2019s like moving this into the spam folder: once they do that, it stops spreading.\u201d According to a Pew Research study, nearly half of all Canadians receive their daily news from social media, demonstrating our vulnerability to disinformation. While Ottawa introduced significant measures to address disinformation before the 2019 election, it fell short of publicly exposing disinformation campaigns. Nor did the government achieve agreements with social media platforms to protect the Canadian online information environment. In December, Taiwan took the additional step of banning foreign funding and backing of political parties by \u201chostile external forces,\u201d while Australia has passed legislation that requires individuals or groups that are acting on behalf of \u201cforeign principals\u201d to register with the government. Despite Beijing\u2019s efforts to undermine Taiwan\u2019s elections and threats to unite Taiwan with mainland China by force, Taiwanese leaders are digging in. Former Taiwanese Minister of Defence Andrew Yang suggests Canada do the same, urging us to wake up by reminding our leaders that \u201cBeijing does not conduct business abiding to international rules.\u201d The determination and clarity with which Taiwan has confronted the challenges to its fragile independence and democracy are encouraging and can serve as an example for Canada and its allies as they struggle to address their own growing problems with Beijing.\n"
