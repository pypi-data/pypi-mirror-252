# Logs

### Log anything from anywhere.

A better and simplified logging system.

### How it works

Initialise your log with:

    log = Log()

To log info, warning, error or debug use the corresponding methods:

    log.info("This is an info")
    log.warning("This is a warning")
    log.error("This is an error")
    log.debug("This is a debug")

A folder named **logs** will automatically be created at the root of the project.

When logging a folder with the *current date* as name is created in the **logs** folder, and a file for each script 
that as a log is created with the corresponding script as name.

ex: *logs/2021-05-05/main.log*

If you want to change the name of the logfile use:

    log = Log("my_log_file_name")

The **any.log** file in each sub **logs** folder contains all the logs from all the scripts.

More details in [Log.py](Log.py)

If you are using an old version of python <= 3.6, before installing the library you need to do:

    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
