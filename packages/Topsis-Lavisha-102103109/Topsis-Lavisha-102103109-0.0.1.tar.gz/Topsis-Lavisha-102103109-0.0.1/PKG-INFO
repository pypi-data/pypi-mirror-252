# Topsis-Abhinandan-102103110

Topsis-Abhinandan-Sharma is a Python library designed for addressing Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problems using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method.

## Installation

You can install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install Topsis-Abhinandan-Sharma
```

## How to Use

To use the library, provide the CSV filename with the ".csv" extension, the weights vector with comma-separated values, the impacts vector with comma-separated signs (+,-), and the output CSV filename with the ".csv" extension.

Example:

```bash
Topsis sample.csv "1,1,1,2,2" "+,+,-,+,+" result.csv
```

## Input (sample.csv)

Fund Name,P1,P2,P3,P4,P5

M1,0.68,0.46,4,52.7,14.46

M2,0.61,0.37,6.9,51.5,14.85

M3,0.61,0.37,4.4,53.5,14.72

M4,0.7,0.49,6,54.5,15.42
