#Project Description

for: Assignment-1 (UCS654) submitted by: Aryan Gupta  Roll no: 102103140   Group: 3COE5

Topsis-Aryan-102103140 is a Python library for dealing with Multiple Criteria Decision Making(MCDM) problems by using Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution(TOPSIS).

#Installation

`pip install Topsis-Aryan-102103145`

How to use it?

Enter csv filename followed by .csv extension, then enter the weights separated by commas, followed by the impacts with comma separated signs (+,-) and then the csv filename in which you want to store the result by .csv extension .

`Topsis sample.csv "1,1,1,2,2" "+,+,-,+,+" result.csv`
