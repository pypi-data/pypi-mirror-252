def get_window_start_stop(indices, n_samples):
    """
    Get the correct starts and stops of windows from indices from the GeneActiv reader

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : numpy.ndarray
        (N, ) array of indices, where N is the number of pages in the file. If the time
        for that page doesn't overlap with either the base/period of a window, then its
        value is set to `-2*expected_num_samples`.
    n_samples : int
        Number of samples in the data read from the GeneActiv file.

    Returns
    -------
    starts : numpy.ndarray
        (M, ) array of the start indices of windows
    stops : numpy.ndarray
        (M, ) array of the stop indices of windows.
