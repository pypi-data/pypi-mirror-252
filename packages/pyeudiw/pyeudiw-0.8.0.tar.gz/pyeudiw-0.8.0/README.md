## Setup

Install enviroment and dependencies
````
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip git
sudo python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
sudo python3 -m pip install virtualenv
````

Activate the environment. It's optional and up to you if you want to install 
in a separate env or system wide
````
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
````

Install using pip:

`pip install pyeudiw` or `pip install pyeudiw[satosa]` for the satosa backend.

Install using github:

`pip install git+https://github.com/italia/eudi-wallet-it-python`

Optionally for generate the documentation you need to install the following packages:
`pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme`


## Documentation

The API documentation is available in the githubpages, [here](https://italia.github.io/eudi-wallet-it-python/).

In the [docs/](docs) folder there are some common example for some specific tasks.


### Build the Documentation
For generate the documentaation enter in the terminal the following commands. 
The last argument is the exclude path, unit tests are then excluded from the API documentation.

````
cd docs
sphinx-apidoc -o ./source ../pyeudiw ../pyeudiw/tests
make html
````


## Example project

The example project is a docker-compose that runs a demo composed by the following component:

- Wordpress with SAML2 support and Bootstrap Italia template preregistered to the IAM Proxy.
- [Satosa-Saml2Spid](https://github.com/italia/Satosa-Saml2Spid) IAM Proxy with a preconfigured OpenID4VP backend.

Please read [this README](example/README.Wordpress.md) to get a fully working Wordpress setup with SAML2 support.


## SatoSa configuration

[SaToSa](https://github.com/IdentityPython/SATOSA) is a general purpose IAM 
proxy solution that allows interoperability between different entities that implements different
authentication protocols such as SAML2, OpenID Connect and OAuth2. This project offers a SaToSa
backend to enable the OpenID4VP protocol.
