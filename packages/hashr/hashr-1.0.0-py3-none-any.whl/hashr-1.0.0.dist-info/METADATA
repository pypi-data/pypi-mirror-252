# hashr

Simply a custom hashing package with optional salting, able to be both run from the command line and imported as a package.

## Installation

To install, just run either of the below commands.

#### Command Line

To use hashr from the command line, run:
```bash

Make sure to surround an input with double quotes if it contains spaces.  
There is also the option to add a salt, which causes duplicate string to have unique hashes. To use this, add the ```-s``` flag to the command.
