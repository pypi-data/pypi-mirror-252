Gather -- gather all plugins into a dictionary

Contributing
============

We welcome all issues, and PRs.
We are committed to a positive environment:
see our code of conduct at the root of the tree.

Running:

.. code::

  $ nox

Should DTRT -- if it passes, it means
unit tests are passing, and 100% coverage.
Pull requests can be submitted without passing :code:`nox`,
but will have to be fixed before merging.
We are happy to give guidance as to fixing.
