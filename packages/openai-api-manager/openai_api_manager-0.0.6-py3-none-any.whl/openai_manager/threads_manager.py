class ThreadsManager:
    """
    Manages the storage and retrieval of threads and messages for an OpenAI application.

    This class handles the interactions between local storage and the remote OpenAI API, 
    specifically focusing on thread management. It provides methods to create, retrieve, 
    and manage threads both locally and remotely. Due to API limitations and the current 
    scope of the class design, it lacks functionality to fetch all threads directly from 
    the remote server, and its capabilities are primarily centered around individual 
    management of known threads.
