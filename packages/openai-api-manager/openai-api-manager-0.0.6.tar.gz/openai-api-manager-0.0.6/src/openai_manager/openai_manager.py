    Manages interactions with the OpenAI API, specifically for retrieving available models.

    This class is designed to encapsulate the functionality related to the OpenAI API, 
    primarily focusing on listing the available models. It currently offers limited 
    additional utility beyond what the OpenAI Python client library provides. 
    This redundancy might not justify its use in a context where direct usage of 
    the OpenAI client library would suffice.

        Retrieves a list of available models from the OpenAI API.

        It returns a list of model identifiers. Note that this method directly interacts with the API
        and does not utilize the OpenAI client library, which might be seen as a redundancy given that
        the client library already provides this functionality.
