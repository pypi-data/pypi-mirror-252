Control the Anova Nano via BLE.

This is a rough translation of [dengelke/node-sous-vide](https://github.com/dengelke/node-sous-vide/).

### Notes:
- The code should be considered experimental at this point.
- Presumably this library is not compatible with any other Anova model!
- The PyAnova class is not compatible with [c3V6a2Vy/pyanova](https://github.com/c3V6a2Vy/pyanova).

# Examples

### Automatic discovery

The device should be found automatically based on the service uuid it provides.

#### Context manager: auto connect and disconnect

```python
import asyncio
from pyanova_nano import PyAnova

async def print_device_sensors():
    async with PyAnova() as client:
        print(await client.get_sensor_values())

asyncio.run(print_device_sensors())
```

#### No context manager

```python
import asyncio

from pyanova_nano import PyAnova


async def get_unit():
    client = PyAnova()
    await client.connect()

    print(await client.get_timer())

    await client.disconnect()


asyncio.run(get_unit())
```

### Manual connection

To use a custom address, first discover all relevant devices, then use `PyAnova.connect(device=my_anova)` with 
`my_anova` being the `bleak.BLEDevice` you want to connect to.

```python
import asyncio

from bleak import BLEDevice

from pyanova_nano import PyAnova


async def print_target_temp():
    client = PyAnova()
    devices: list[BLEDevice] = await client.discover(connect=False, list_all=True)
    # Select the device to use.
    my_anova = next(iter(devices))

    print(f"Found: {my_anova.address}")

    await client.connect(device=my_anova)

    temperature = await client.get_target_temperature()
    print(temperature)
    
    await client.disconnect()


asyncio.run(print_target_temp())
```
