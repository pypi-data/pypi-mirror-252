        Adds a copper wire power connection between two entities. Each entity
        can be either a reference to the original entity to connect, the index
        of the entity in the ``entities`` list, or it's string ID. Tuples of
        strings and ints mean to recursively search through
        :py:class:`EntityCollection` instances in the base level, following the
        logic of :py:meth:`.EntityList.__getitem__`. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            blueprint.entities.append("small-electric-pole")
            group = Group("group") # Type of EntityCollection
            group.entities.append("small-electric-pole", tile_position=(5, 0))

            # in the group
            blueprint.add_power_connection(blueprint.entities[0], ("group", 0))

        Side specifies which side to connect to when establishing a
        connection to a dual-power-connectable entity (usually a power-switch).
        Does nothing if the connection already exists.

        Raises :py:class:`~draftsman.warning.ConnectionRangeWarning` if the
        distance between the two entities exceeds the maximum wire distance
        between the two.

        Raises :py:class:`~draftsman.warning.TooManyConnectionsWarning` if
        either of the power poles exceed 5 connections when this connection is
        added.

        .. NOTE::

            ``side`` is in 1-based notation (1 and 2, input and output) which is
            identical to circuit connections. Internally, however, the
            connections are represented in 0-based notation as "Cu0" and "Cu1"
            respectively.

        .. NOTE::

            You might notice that unlike :py:meth:`add_circuit_connection`,
            there is only one ``side`` argument. This is because it is actually
            impossible to connect two dual-power-connectable entities with one
            another; they must be connected to a power pole in-between.
