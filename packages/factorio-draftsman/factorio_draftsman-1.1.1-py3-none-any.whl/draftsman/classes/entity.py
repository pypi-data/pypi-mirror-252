        Converts the Entity to its JSON dict representation. The keys returned
        are determined by the contents of the `exports` dictionary and their
        criteria functions.

        A attribute from the Entity will be included as a key in the output dict
        if both of the following conditions are met:

        1. The attribute is in the ``exports`` dictionary
        2. The associated criteria function is either not present or returns
           ``True``. This is used to avoid including excess keys, keeping
           Blueprint string size down.

        In addition, a second function may be provided to have a formatting step
        to alter either the key and/or its value, which gets inserted into the
