# warning.py

"""
Draftsman warnings. Used to enforce "Factorio-correctness", or the belief that
operations in Draftsman that are unorthodox or ignored on import to Factorio 
should be mentioned to the user.
"""


class DraftsmanWarning(UserWarning):
    """
    Root warning class for Draftsman. Useful if you want to easily ignore
    all warnings issued from the module without getting rid of warnings entirely;
    simply filter this class. This is a subclass of ``UserWarning``, and all
    other Draftsman warnings are subclasses of this.
    """

    pass


class ValueWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Generic warning, similar to ``ValueError``. Raised when a input value is
    incorrect, but wont cause the blueprint to fail import.
    """

    pass


class DirectionWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the direction does not match the rotation type, e.g. setting
    a 4-way rotatable Entity's direction to :py:data:`.Direction.NORTHWEST` (an
    8-way directional value).
    """

    pass


class FlippingWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when attempting to flip an entity that may or not be able to be
    flipped. This is only raised when flipping an :py:class:`.EntityCollection`
    with modded entities.
    """

    pass  # TODO: remove


class IndexWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the index of some element is out of expected range, though not
    to the point of failing import into Factorio.
    """

    pass


class ConnectionDistanceWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when an attempted wire connection is too distant to be properly
    resolved in-game.
    """

    pass


class ConnectionSideWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when an attempted wire connection is made to an invalid side of the
    Entity.
    """

class TooManyConnectionsWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when a power connection is attempted between an power-pole that
    already has 5 or more connections.
    """

    pass


class RailAlignmentWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when an Entity is placed on odd coordinates when it's type restricts
    it's placement to the rail grid (even coordinates).
    """

    pass


class ItemLimitationWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when an item request does not match the particular entities valid
    item-types, such as incorrect ingredients for an :py:class:`.AssemblingMachine`
    with a recipe, or a :py:class:`.Lab` with non-science pack inputs.
    """

    pass


class ItemCapacityWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the volume of item requests exeeds the number of inventory slots
    of the entity, such as requesting 10,000 iron plate to a ``"wooden-chest"``.
    """

    pass


class ModuleLimitationWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the modules inside of an :py:class:`.Entity` conflict, either
    with the Entity's type or it's recipe.
    """

    pass


class ModuleCapacityWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the number of modules in an :py:class:`.Entity` with module slots
    exceeds the total module capacity.
    """

    pass


class TemperatureRangeWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the temperature of a heat interface is outside of the range
    ``[0, 1000]``.
    """

    pass


class VolumeRangeWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the volume of a programmable speaker is outside of the range
    ``[0.0, 1.0]``
    """

class HiddenEntityWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when an Entity that is marked as hidden is placed within a blueprint.
    """

    pass


class OverlappingObjectsWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when the :py:class:`.CollisionSet` of a :py:class:`.SpatialLike`
    object overlaps the :py:class:`.CollisionSet` of another object, and that
    their :py:attr:`~.Entity.collision_mask` s intersect. In layman's terms, if
    two or more tiles or entities are placed on top of each other such that they
    would not be able to be placed in-game, this warning is raised.
    """

    pass


class UselessConnectionWarning(DraftsmanWarning):
    """
    Raised when a circuit connection is functionally useless, such as when a
    wall is connected with a circuit wire without an adjacent :py:class:`.Gate`.
