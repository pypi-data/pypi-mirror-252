    - analysis: List of tuples: ((pcset, duration), new_harmonic_state, sauterian_formula), where (pcset, duration) are the musical events from music and new_harmonic_state is the new harmonic state (a list of keys) after this event.
    sauterian_formula is a tuple of two lists: (tonal_result, atonal_pitches). tonal_result is a list of 9 booleans in the order: T1, T3, T5, D1, D3, D5, S1, S3, S5. This roughly corresponds to whether the scale degree for each field is used in the event, with exceptions: The scale degree 1 could be seen as T1 or as S5, the scale degree 5 could be seen as T5 or as D1. The sauterian_formula is defined in a way that the result is the most consonant interpretation (See degree_of_dissonances for more information). Example: The Chord CEG in C-Dur could be seen as T1,T3,T5,D1,S5, but removing D1 and S5 results in a less dissonant interpretation: T1,T3,T5, while still all pitches are used. For CEGA however, the sauterian_formula would be T1,T3,T5,S3,S5 because removing the S5 would not result in a more consonant interpretation. atonal_pitches is a list of pitches that are not in the key of the harmonic state.
    atonal_pitches is a list of pitches that are not in the key of the harmonic state.
    If a harmonic state of an event has multiple keys, the sauterian formula for this event is not defined and has the value 'ind.' ('indifference') instead.
    If the event has no pitches (a rest), sauterian_formula is '/'.

    Output:
    - analysis: List of tuples: ((pcset, duration), new_harmonic_state, sauterian_formula, degree_of_dissonance_or_atonal).

    Adds the degree of dissonance for each harmony to the analysis.

    degree_of_dissonance is either:
    Either "con", "fcon", "low", "mid", "high", "A1", "A2", "A3", "A4" or "A5". Or "ind." or "/".

    "high": high dissonance
    "A<n>": atonal with n atonal pitches
    "ind.": indifferent: not atonal, but dissonance grade can't be determined because there are multiple keys in the harmonic state.
    "/": no pitches in this event.

    order of calculation:
    1. atonality
    2. pcset with exactly one pitch -> consonant
    3. indifferent or rest
    4. dissonance_degree.
    -> If the pcset is atonal and the harmonic state is indifferent, it will still be marked as atonal.
    -> a pcset with exactly one pitch is consonant, even in an indifferent harmonic state. (Because it will surely be consonant in every key.)
