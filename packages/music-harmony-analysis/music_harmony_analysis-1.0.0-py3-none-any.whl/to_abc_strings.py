    Input:
    - analysis: List of tuples: (event, harmonic_state, sauterian_formula, degree_of_dissonance_or_atonal).
    event is a tuple of a pcset and a duration. pcset is a list of ints from 0-11.
    harmonic_state is a list of keys: (pitchclass, mode), where pitchclass is a int in range 0-11 and mode is 'dur' or 'moll'.
    sauterian_formula is a string ('ind.' if there is not exactly one key, '/' if the event is a rest) or a tuple of two lists: (tonal_result, atonal_pitches).
    tonal_result is a list of 9 booleans in the order: T1, T3, T5, D1, D3, D5, S1, S3, S5. This roughly corresponds to whether the scale degree for each field is used in the event, with exceptions: The scale degree 1 could be seen as T1 or as S5, the scale degree 5 could be seen as T5 or as D1. The sauterian_formula is defined in a way that the result is the most consonant interpretation (See degree_of_dissonances for more information). Example: The Chord CEG in C-Dur could be seen as T1,T3,T5,D1,S5, but removing D1 and S5 results in a less dissonant interpretation: T1,T3,T5, while still all pitches are used. For CEGA however, the sauterian_formula would be T1,T3,T5,S3,S5 because removing the S5 would not result in a more consonant interpretation.
    atonal_pitches is a list of pitches that are not in the key of the harmonic state.
    degree_of_dissonance_or_atonal is a string: 'con', 'fcon', 'low', 'mid', 'high', 'A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'A4', 'A5', 'indiff.' or '/'.

    - harmony_lines: List of lines/voices (exactly one voice per line), where each voice is a list of events. Each event has a 'pitches' and a 'duration' field.
    The events in analysis have to be the same as the events in harmony_lines, only with a different representation. The events in analysis are replaced by the events in harmony_lines in to_abc_strings_preprocess. 
    - mode: 'pc', 'pac' or 'custom'. See event_to_abc_string for more information.
    - custom_pitch_to_abc_method: function. Maps a pitch representation to a string. Needed if mode is 'custom'.

    Output:
    - analysis_abc_strings: Dictionary with the following fields:
    - header: String. The header of the abc analysis: '\nL:1\n'.
    - events: List of strings. Format: '[V: Analysis] [CE^^G]1/4 [C_EGB]1/4\n'. ('[V: Analysis name=Analysis snm=A.]' for the first line) Each string represents the harmonies of one line of music.
    - harmonic_states: List of strings. Format: 'w: [C,Cis,Dm] [C,Cis,Dm]\n'. Each string corresponds to the events of one line.
    - sauterian_formula: List of strings. Format: 'w: T15D15S3 D35S1A3,11\n'. Each string corresponds to the events of one line.
    - degree_of_dissonance_or_atonal: List of strings. Format: 'w: / low\n'. Each string corresponds to the events of one line.
