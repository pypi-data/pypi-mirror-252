    Calculates the harmonic analysis of the given music. A harmonic state is the set of all keys that a listener of the music can consider as the current key, based on a theory of musical harmony perception https://www.tonalemusik.de/lexikon/modulation.htm#Modulation.
    For most of the time in tonal music, this harmonic state is a single key, but there are times where there are multiple possible keys simultaneously ('tonale Indifferenz').

    Example:

    Calculates all possible keys for the given pcset and returns them as a list of keys. (1. in the algorithm from the paper)
    Possible keys are all keys, where a maximum of the pitchclasses of the pcset are in the key.
