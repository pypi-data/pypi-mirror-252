def sauterian_formula(event_analysis):
    """
    Input:
    - event_analysis: ((pcset, duration), harmonic_state), (but duration is not needed here), each pitch in pcset is a int in range 0-11. harmonic_state is a list of keys: (pitchclass, mode), where pitchclass is a int in range 0-11 and mode is 'dur' or 'moll'.
    
    Output:
    - sauterian_formula: Tuple of two lists: (tonal_result, atonal_pitches).
    tonal_result is a list of 9 booleans in the order: T1, T3, T5, D1, D3, D5, S1, S3, S5. This roughly corresponds to whether the scale degree for each field is used in the event, with exceptions: The scale degree 1 could be seen as T1 or as S5, the scale degree 5 could be seen as T5 or as D1. The sauterian_formula is defined in a way that the result is the most consonant interpretation (See degree_of_dissonances for more information). Example: The Chord CEG in C-Dur could be seen as T1,T3,T5,D1,S5, but removing D1 and S5 results in a less dissonant interpretation: T1,T3,T5, while still all pitches are used. For CEGA however, the sauterian_formula would be T1,T3,T5,S3,S5 because removing the S5 would not result in a more consonant interpretation.
    atonal_pitches is a list of pitches that are not in the key of the harmonic state.
    If the sauterian formula is not defined for this event, 'ind.' or '/' is returned.
    'ind.' is returned if the harmonic state has multiple keys.
    '/' is returned if the event has no pitches (a rest).

    Calculates the sauterian formula for the given event and harmonic state.
