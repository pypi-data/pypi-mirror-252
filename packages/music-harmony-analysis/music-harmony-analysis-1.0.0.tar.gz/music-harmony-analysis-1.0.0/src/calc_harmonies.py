def calc_harmonies(voices, note_equal_function = lambda x, y: x == y):
    """
    Input:
    - voices: a list of voices, where each voice is a list of Events, where each Event has a list of pitches and a duration. (All the voices of one line of music)
    
    The representation of a pitch is not specified here. It can be a pc_note, a pac_note, or any other representation of a pitch. ('pc' means pitch class, 'pac' means pitch and accidentals. )
    But for custom representations of pitches you have to provide a note_equal_function:
    - note_equal_function: a function, which takes two pitches and returns True if they are equal, False otherwise.
    The default value for note_equal_function is lambda x, y: x == y, which works for pc_notes and pac_notes.

    pc: Pitches are represented as: Int in range 0-11
    pac: Pitches are represented as: Object (python dictionary) with two fields: 'pitch': Int in range 0-6 (for c,d,e,f,g,a,b), 'acc': String in ['none', 'sharp', 'flat', 'natural', 'dblsharp', 'dblflat'] (the accidental of the pitch)
    The PAC-Representation is useful if the resulting harmonies should be displayed as classical notes (like in abcjs), where enharmonic notes are displayed as different notes.

    Output: Depending on Input-Event-Representation:
    voices of Events: One voice: a list of Events with the same representation as the input events.

    This function gets multiple voices and calculates the resulting harmonies, and the duration of these harmonies.
    Each time a note or rest in one voice starts, a new harmony is created.

    Example:
    Informal notation:
    Voice1: [A,C]2, [G,C]2, [A,C]1
    Voice2: [C]4, [F]2, [E]4, [F]1
    Outputvoice: [A,C]4, [A,C,F]4, [G,C,F]4, [G,C,E]4, [A,C,F]1
