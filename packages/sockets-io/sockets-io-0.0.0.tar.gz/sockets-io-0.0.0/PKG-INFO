### dependencies:
- opening:
  As for this is a really complex program, which uses a lot of modules, there are required dependencies needed
  in order to run the program. keep in mined the program was writen in python 3.8.6, so any python version lower
  than 3.9.2 might not work properly. Moreover, built-in python modules are being used, so keep that in mind.
