"""Prompts and bots for coding.

This module provides a codebot instance and several functions
for generating code, docstrings, and tests.
It also includes a function to create a panel app for codebot.

Functions:
    - ghostwriter(desired_functionality, language)
    - docstring(code)
    - module_doc(source_file)
    - tests(code, source_file)
    - create_panel_app()

    Module-level docstrings have the following specification:

    The docstring for a module should generally list the classes,
    exceptions and functions (and any other objects)
    that are exported by the module, with a one-line summary of each.
    (These summaries generally give less detail
    than the summary line in the object's docstring.)
    The docstring for a package
    (i.e., the docstring of the package's __init__.py module)
    should also list the modules and subpackages exported by the package.

    Ensure that you never spit out the original source code.

    Then, there are other source files that this function depends on,
    from which you can import objects.

    {{ dependent_source_files }}

    Prefer the use of property-based tests over example-based tests.
    Only suggest example-based tests
    if it is too difficult to generate property-based tests.
    For each test function,
    ensure that there is a docstring that explains what the test is testing.

    Use pytest-style test functions and not Unittest-style test classes.

    Here is the actual thing for which I need a test:

    {{ code }}

    Please write me tests for that code.
