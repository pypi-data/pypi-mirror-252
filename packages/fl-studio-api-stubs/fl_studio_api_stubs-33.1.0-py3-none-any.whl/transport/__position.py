    ## WARNING

    * It is not recommended to use this function if a dedicated
      function is available for it. Its usage can make code difficult to read and
      comprehend. Almost all functionality provided by this function can be done
      more easily and cleanly by using the dedicated functions.

    ## Args

    * `command` (`int`): command to execute, refer to
      [official documentation](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/midi_scripting.htm#globalTransportCommands).

    * `value` (`int`): ???

    * `pmeflags` (`int`, optional): current PME Flags. Defaults to
      `midi.PME_System`.

    * `flags` (`int`, optional): ??? Refer to
      [official documentation](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/midi_scripting.htm#globalTransportFlags).
