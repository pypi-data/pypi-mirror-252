## Deprecated as of v33.0.0

This module is deprecated, and intended to be removed in a future version of
FL Studio API Stubs.

Provides a model of FL Studio, which integrates with the other stub files in
order to facilitate testing of MIDI scripts.

NOTE: This module is not included in FL Studio's runtime, and should not be
imported from within your main script. It is intended to be used within a
testing framework in order to help validate the behavior of MIDI scripts.
