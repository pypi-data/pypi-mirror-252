This package implements multiple GPU-compatible PyTorch solvers
to the Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport problem.

**This package is under active development. There is no guarantee that the API and solvers
won't change in the near future.**

## Installation

**To install this package, make sure you have an up-to-date version of** `pip`.

### From PyPI

In a dedicated Python env, run:

```bash
pip install fugw
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexisthual/fugw.git
cd fugw
```

In a dedicated Python env, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Contributors should also install the development dependencies
in order to test and automatically format their contributions.

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

Tests run on CPU and GPU, depending on the configuration of your machine.
You can run them with:

```bash
pytest
```
