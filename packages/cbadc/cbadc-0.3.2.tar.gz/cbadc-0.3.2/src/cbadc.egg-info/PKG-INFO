# Control-Bounded A/D Conversion (cbadc) Toolbox

This package is intended as a design tool for aiding the construction of control-bounded A/D converters.
Specifically, it is capable of:

- **Generating** transfer functions for analog systems and/or digital estimator parametrizations.
- **Estimating** samples from control signals.
- **Simulating** analog system and digital control interactions.

# Documentation

The project's official documentation can be found at [Read the Docs](https://cbadc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
