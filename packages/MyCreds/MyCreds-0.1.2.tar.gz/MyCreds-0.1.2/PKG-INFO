The MyCreds project is a python program developed for WatSPEED internal use. Given a course and section number, the program scrapes the student portal (DestinyOne) for a list of students who passed and their data. The program also produces files needed to be uploaded to MyCreds: MyCredsCertificate.csv, and PDF certificates for each passing student.
