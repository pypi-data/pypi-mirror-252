UNCERTAIN
=========

Python module to keep track of uncertainties in mathematical calculations.


Usage example
-------------
- Define uncertain values
  
.. code:: python

	  import uncertain as uc

	  # Uncertain value between 3 and 8 and a normal distribution with
	  # mean=5 and standard deviation=1.
	  a = uc.UncertainValue(5, 3, 8, 'normal', [5, 1]) 

	  # Uncertain value with a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 4
	  b = uc.UncertainValue(1, 0.1, 4)

	  # Uncertain value from measured data points
	  c = uc.from_data([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

- Perform mathematical calculations: addition, substraction, multiplication, power, sine, cosine, tangent. In order for the trigonometric functions to work, they need to be called from `numpy` (`math` does not work).

.. code:: python
  
	  d = -b+2*a**(b/3)


.. code:: python
  
	  import numpy as np
	  e = np.pi / 180 * uc.UncertainValue(40, 35, 45)
	  f = np.sin(e) + np.cos(e) + np.cos(e)

- Display properties and plot results in density plots or cumulative density plots

.. code:: python
	  
	  print(c.describe(),
	  "\n\nThe standard deviation of b is "+str(b.std),
	  "\n\nThe probability of /c/ being between 2 and 6 is " +
	  str(probability_in_interval(c, [2, 6])))

	  a.plot_distribution(title="Uncertain numbers", label="a")
	  b.plot_distribution(label="b", alpha=0.5)
	  d.plot_distribution(label="d", alpha=0.5)

	  d.plot_distribution(plot_type='cdf', new_figure=True)

Output:
