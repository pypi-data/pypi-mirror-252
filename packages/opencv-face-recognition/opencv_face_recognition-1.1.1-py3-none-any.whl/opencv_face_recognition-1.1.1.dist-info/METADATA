# OpenCV Face Recognition Python SDK

Introducing OpenCV-Face-Recognition, the cutting-edge Python SDK that's transforming biometric authentication in security and technology sectors. Our deep learning-driven library offers an array of powerful features including:

* **Face Registration & Search**: Easily register individuals using their facial images and swiftly search for registered persons, streamlining user management.
* **Grouping into Collections**: Organize individuals into collections for better management and quick retrieval.
* **Face Comparison**: Utilize our advanced algorithms to compare two faces and determine if they belong to the same person with unparalleled accuracy.
* **Liveness Checks**: Stay ahead of spoofing attempts with our sophisticated liveness checks, ensuring that each photo is genuine.

Ideal for applications in attendance checking, access monitoring, building security, criminal identification, and KYC processes, OpenCV-Face-Recognition excels in scenarios demanding high security and precision.

**Top-Notch Performance Metrics**: Standing out in the industry, our library boasts a 99.99% accuracy rate and a less than 1% false non-match rate, backed by a top 8 ranking in NIST evaluations as of Q1 2022. Our unique single-image liveness detection feature not only enhances user experience but also meets Level 2 compliance as per ISO 30107-3 standards.

**Universal Compatibility**: As a JSON REST-based API, our SDK seamlessly integrates into any internet-connected device capable of facial image capture, making it universally adaptable.

**SaaS Model Licensing**: We offer a flexible monthly subscription model, making cutting-edge facial recognition technology accessible and scalable for your organization.

Elevate your security and technology features with OpenCV-Face-Recognition – where innovation meets reliability.
