class SecretString:
    """
    TODO

    ``SecretString`` cannot be instantiated. It is not meant to be used
    as an actual type but only as a type **hint** when declaring config
    entries within a config section. It allows the parser to handle those
    entries differently (e.g. by forbidding the use of default values) and
    conveys their intended usage and their secrecy to the user.

    In the end, the actual type of the config entries is simply ``str``.
