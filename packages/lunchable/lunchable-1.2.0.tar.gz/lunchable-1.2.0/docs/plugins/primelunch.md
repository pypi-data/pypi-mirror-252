`PrimeLunch` is a command line tool that supports updating Amazon transaction notes with the items from
Amazon itself. This tool uses CSVs generated by the
[Amazon Order History Reporter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-order-history-repo/mgkilgclilajckgnedgjgnfdokkgnibi)
plugin on Chrome. Once you've gathered your transactions, export them as a CSV and scan them with the tool.
You'll be asked which transactions you'd like to update.

The plugin uses the dollar amounts on the CSV export to match Amazon transactions in LunchMoney.
When a matching dollar amount is found, `PrimeLunch` compares the date window between the transactions
to determine if they're really a match.

We're using
the [Amazon Order History Reporter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-order-history-repo/mgkilgclilajckgnedgjgnfdokkgnibi)
plugin because it gives us some functionality that Amazon doesn't: exporting Amazon transactions as they're
grouped on actual credit card transactions.

## Run via the [Lunchable CLI](../cli.md#lunchable-cli)

You can install lunchable with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/lunchable/) or
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/):

```shell
pipx install "lunchable[primelunch]"
```

```shell
pip install "lunchable[primelunch]"
```

The below command runs the `PrimeLunch` update tool:

```shell
lunchable plugins primelunch run -f ~/Downloads/amazon_order_history.csv
```

> IMPORTANT: **Windows Users**
>
>    The commands on this documentation correspond to running on a
>    Mac or Linux Machine. If you are a Windows user take note of the following items:
>
>    -   Multiline commands in Windows machines use the `^` character instead of `\` to escape new lines
>    -   On macs, the default CSV file is located at `~/Downloads/amazon_order_history.csv`, on Windows this file
>        is located someplace like `C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\amazon_order_history.csv`
>    -   My personal recommendation is to use the
>        [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701)
>        along with
>        [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to
>        access a Linux shell on your Windows machine. This will allow you to use the commands
>        as written.

The below command runs the `PrimeLunch` update tool using a date window of fourteen days
instead of the default seven days (these larger windows are especially useful for finding refunds and recurring
purchases):

```shell
lunchable plugins primelunch run \
   --file ~/Downloads/amazon_order_history.csv \
   --window 14
```

Update all transactions without going through the confirmation prompt for each one:

```shell
lunchable plugins primelunch run \
   --file ~/Downloads/amazon_order_history.csv \
   --all
```

Provide a LunchMoney API access token manually (`PrimeLunch` defaults to inheriting from the `LUNCHMONEY_ACCESS_TOKEN`
environment variable):

```shell
lunchable plugins primelunch run \
   --file ~/Downloads/amazon_order_history.csv \
   --token ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP
```
