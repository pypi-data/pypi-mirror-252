# dolfin_warp
A set of FEniCS- and VTK-based python tools for Finite Element Digital Image Correlation, basically implementing the method described in [[Genet, Stoeck, von Deuster, Lee & Kozerke (2018). Equilibrated Warping: Finite Element Image Registration with Finite Strain Equilibrium Gap Regularization. Medical Image Analysis, 50, 1â€“22.]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2018.07.007).
### Requirements
You need a working installation of FEniCS (including DOLFIN python interface) & VTK (also including python interface).
