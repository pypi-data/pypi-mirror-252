    "# Simplified Concurrency\n",
    "`labbench` includes simplified concurrency support for this kind of I/O-constrained operations like waiting for instruments to perform long operations. It is not suited for parallelizing CPU-intensive tasks because the operations share a single process on one CPU core, instead of multiprocessing, which may be able to spread operations across multiple CPU cores.\n",
