        Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
        does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
        Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
        other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

        Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
        
        Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
        conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
        original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
        and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
        following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
        exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
        
             Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
             intended for use by those authorized to give the public
             permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
             copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
             irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
             and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
             Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
             applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
             material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
             material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
             licensed material, or material used under an exception or
             limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

             Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
             licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
             licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
             the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
             example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
             copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
             licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
             other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
             the licensed material may still be restricted for other
             reasons, including because others have copyright or other
             rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
             such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
             Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
             respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

        contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
        acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
        such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from

             arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
             permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
             Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
             Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,

             and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in

             categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
             specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar

             Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.
        
          j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights

             process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such

             available to the public including in ways that members of the
             public may access the material from a place and at a time

          l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright

             as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
             equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
        
          m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
             under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.
        
        
        Section 2 -- Scope.
        
          a. License grant.
        
               1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
                  the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
                  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
                  exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
        
                    a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                       in part; and
        
                    b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
        
               2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
                  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
                  License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
                  its terms and conditions.
        
               3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
                  6(a).
        
               4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
                  Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
                  all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
                  and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
                  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
                  authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
                  necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
                  technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
                  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
                  simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
                  (4) never produces Adapted Material.
        
               5. Downstream recipients.
        
                    a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                       recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                       receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                       Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                       Public License.
        
                    b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                       Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                       automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                       exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                       under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
        
                    c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                       any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                       apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                       Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                       Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                       Material.
        
               6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
                  may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
                  are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
                  with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
                  the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
                  provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
        
          b. Other rights.
        
               1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
                  licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
                  privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
                  the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
                  assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
                  extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
                  Rights, but not otherwise.
        
               2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
                  Public License.
        
               3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
                  collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
                  Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
                  under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
                  licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
                  reserves any right to collect such royalties.
        
        
        Section 3 -- License Conditions.
        
        Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
        following conditions.
        
          a. Attribution.
        
               1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
                  form), You must:
        
                    a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                       with the Licensed Material:
        
                         i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                            Material and any others designated to receive
                            attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                            the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                            designated);
        
                        ii. a copyright notice;
        
                       iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
        
                        iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                            warranties;
        
                         v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                            extent reasonably practicable;
        
                    b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                       retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
        
                    c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                       Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                       hyperlink to, this Public License.
        
               2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
                  reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
                  which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
                  reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
                  hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
                  information.
        
               3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
                  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
                  reasonably practicable.
        
          b. ShareAlike.
        
             In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
             Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
        
               1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
                  license with the same License Elements, this version or
                  later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
        
               2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
                  Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
                  in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
                  context in which You Share Adapted Material.
        
               3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
                  or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
                  Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
                  rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
        
        
        Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
        
        Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
        apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
        
          a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
             to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
             portion of the contents of the database;
        
          b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
             contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
             Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
        
             including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
          c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
             all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
        replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
        Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
        
        
        Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
        
          a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
             EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
             AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
             ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
             IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
             PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
             ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
             KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
             ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
             TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
             NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
             INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
             COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
             USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
             ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
             DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
             IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
        
          c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
             above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
             possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
             waiver of all liability.
        
        
        Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
        
          a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
             Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
             this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
             terminate automatically.
        
          b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
             Section 6(a), it reinstates:
        
               1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
                  it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
                  violation; or
        
               2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
        
             For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
             right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
             of this Public License.
        
          c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
             Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
             distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
             will not terminate this Public License.
        
          d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
             License.
        
        
        Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
        
          a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
             terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
        
          b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the

             independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
        
        
        Section 8 -- Interpretation.
        
          a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
             shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
             conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
             be made without permission under this Public License.
        
          b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
             deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
             minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
             cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
             without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
             conditions.
        
          c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
             failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
             Licensor.
        
          d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
             as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities

## Requirements

### Build Dependencies

To compile this project yourself, you must install ANTLR. You can view more information at https://www.antlr.org/. For most linux distributions, this will be available as `antlr4` through your package manager.

### Runtime Dependencies

You must install JPEXS Free Flash Decompiler to use this patcher. For more information, check https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler. This will need to be installed manually.

Flash Patcher will automatically detect your FFDec install location.

You must have Python 3.10 or greater on your system to run this script, including the `antlr4-python3-runtime` pip package. This will be installed and verified automatically when installing through pip.

## Testing

To run unit tests, simply run `make test` from the `build` folder. You must have `pytest` and `coverage` installed to run unit tests.

## Installing and running

To apply a patch, run the `flash-patcher` command.

The patcher will take the input SWF, apply the patches specified in the stage file (which must be located in the patch folder), and create the output SWF.

The recommended way to install Flash Patcher is through pip. You can do this with `pip install flash-patcher`.

If you want to build the Flash Patcher .whl file locally, run `cd build && make`. The .whl will be generated in the dist/ folder. The `hatch` pip package is required to run the build. You can also run `make install` to install the package locally. **Note that this will run pip with `--break-system-packages` and `--force-reinstall` options, so use this at your own risk.**

The command line arguments are as follows:

### Required arguments
- `--inputswf`: The input SWF to use. You should create a base hack to avoid issues with Flash deobfuscation.
- `--folder`: The top-level folder where all your patch, asset, and stage files are located.
- `--stagefile`: The stage file's path within the top level folder.
- `--outputswf`: The path to save the output swf (relative to the current path)

Example: `$PATCHER --inputswf $SWF_FILE_PATH/SMF_Base_Hack.swf --folder . --stagefile fullgame.stage --outputswf SMF-Fullgame-Build-$1.swf`

### Optional arguments
- `--invalidateCache`: Force the patcher to decompile the SWF. If this flag is not set, Flash Patcher may use a cached version of the SWF decompilation to speed up the process.
- `--all`: Recompile the full SWF. This is required when injecting asset packs but slows down recompilation.
- `--xml`: Inject in xml mode. This decompiles the .swf to .xml and allows you to modify the xml file.

## File Structure

You should create the following file structure for your patches:

- Create a top-level patch folder. You will put all your files in this folder.
- Create one or more patch stage files. These specify which patches to apply.
- Create one or more patch files. These contain the code to inject into the SWF.

### Patch Stage Files

A patch stage file (usually ending in .stage), may look something like this:

```
# Comment

patch1.patch
subfolder/patch2.patch
subfolder/pack.assets
script.py
```

You can use \# to comment out certain lines. Each line contains a patch file to run, and each injected file must be in the same top-level patch folder as the stage file. When the patcher runs, it will apply each patch file in order.

### Patch Files

A patch file (which must end in .patch), may look something like this:

```
# Comment

add DefineSprite_1058 boss2/DoAction.as 789
begin-patch
_root.gotoAndStop(15);
// cmd: skip 15
end-patch

remove frame_1/DoAction.as 789-1111
```

Every patch file consists of a set of commands, separated by newlines. You can use \# to write comments. The first parameter to any command is the file to modify (in this case, "DefineSprite_1058 boss2/DoAction.as" or "frame_1/DoAction.as"). To find the name of this, export all scripts using FFDec and make a note of the file name you want to modify.

#### `add` command
You are allowed to put multiple `add` statements before a code block you wish to inject.

The first parameter to the add or remove command is always the name of the file to inject into.

The add and remove parameters can come in the following forms:
- `add file.as 567`. This will inject at line 567 in `file.as`.
- `add file.as end`. This will inject at the end of `file.as`.
- `add file.as function Mainfunc`. This will inject after the definition of `Mainfunc` in `file.as`.
- `add file.as function Mainfunc 15`. This will inject after the definition of `Mainfunc` in `file.as`, with an offset of 15 lines from the start of `Mainfunc`.


#### `remove` command

Note that `remove` commands are inclusive of the final line.

Here is an example `remove` command. Note that you can still use the `function` and `end` targets as shown above.

- `remove file.as 567-568`. This will remove lines 567 to 568 of `file.as`.

#### `replace` command

Note that just like `add`, you can put multiple `replace` statements before a code block.

Here is an example `replace` command. Note that you can still use the `function` and `end` targets as shown above, as well as any `// cmd: ` commands.

```
replace file.as 3
begin-content
A
end-content
begin-patch
B
end-patch
```

This will look for the 3rd instance of `A` in `file.as`, and replace it with `B`.

Putting a function + offset of N instead of a raw number will find and replace the Nth instance of the content after the function header, and putting `end` will replace the last instance of the content.

#### `replace-all` command

As with the other commands, you can have multiple `replace-all` headers before the blocks. The syntax is mostly the same as the replace command, with the `content` and `patch` blocks operating in the same way. However, the header is changed:

```
replace-all file.as
```

We only need to specify the filename, as nothing else is used.

**Caveats**

There are several limitations that come with the `replace-all` command:

- You may not use both `replace` and `replace-all` headers for the same block, as this is invalid syntax.
- `replace-all` blocks do not support secondary commands.

#### Content Insertion

For the add command, all lines up to (but not including) the `end-patch` command will be inserted into the SWF, *on* the specified line. For the remove command, all lines between the two numbers specified will be removed (and this is inclusive).

After one or more add commands, add a newline, a `begin-patch\n` and then enter your code block. At the end of the block, add a newline and `end-patch` to tell the patcher the patch is finished.

#### Secondary commands

Within a code block, you can also use the following syntax to skip ahead within the file:
```
// cmd: skip N
```

Type `// cmd: skip ` (with spaces as shown), then the number of lines you wish to skip without modifying.

To inject while in XML mode, use normal `.patch` files, but the add location will be the hardcoded string `swf.xml`.

### Asset Packs

An asset pack file (which must end in .assets), contains instructions on assets to inject into the Flash file. Currently supported types include:

- Images
- Sounds
- Shapes
- Text

The file will look something like this:

```
# Comment
add-asset localfolder/derp.png images/8.png
```

This asset pack file takes the local file at `localfolder/derp.png` and copies it to `images/8.png` within the SWF. If there was already a file named `images/8.png`, it will be overwritten with the new file.

### Python Files

Arbitrary Python scripts can be referenced in the stage file. They should be placed in the patch folder, and will be executed inside the decompiled directory, with the following API:

- Only Python 3 is supported.
- The name of the Python file must not contain spaces.
- You must print a list of files that are modified. This list must be comma-separated and formatted in UTF-8.

An example of such a list: `DoAction1.as, DoAction2.as`. Trailing whitespace or newlines are fine, as those will be stripped off.

### Injection Order

Patchfiles and asset packs will be applied in the order that they are specified in the stage file. Within each patchfile, the patches will be processed one block at a time, with each `add` or `remove` being processed from the top of the file to the bottom. Note that if you are injecting multiple times into the same file, this means that you should inject bottom to top to avoid the line numbers changing as the file is being patched.
