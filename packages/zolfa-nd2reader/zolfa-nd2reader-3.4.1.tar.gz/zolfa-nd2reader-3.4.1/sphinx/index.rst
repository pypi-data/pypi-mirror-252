``nd2reader``: a pure-Python package for reading Nikon .nd2 files
=================================================================

`nd2reader` is a pure-Python package that reads images produced by NIS Elements 4.0+. It has only been definitively tested on NIS Elements 4.30.02 Build 1053. Support for older versions is being actively worked on.
The reader is written in the `pims <https://github.com/soft-matter/pims>`_ framework, enabling easy access to multidimensional files, lazy slicing, and nice display in IPython. To get started, see the quick start tutorial.
