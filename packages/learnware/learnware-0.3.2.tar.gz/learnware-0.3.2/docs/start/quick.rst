Introduction
==================== 

This ``Quick Start`` guide aims to illustrate the straightforward process of establishing a full ``Learnware`` workflow 
and utilizing ``Learnware`` to handle user tasks.


Installation
====================

Learnware is currently hosted on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/learnware/>`_. You can easily intsall the ``learnware`` package by following these steps:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install learnware

In the ``learnware`` package, besides the base classes, many core functionalities such as "learnware specification generation" and "learnware deployment" rely on the ``torch`` library. Users have the option to manually install ``torch``, or they can directly use the following command to install the ``learnware`` package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install learnware[full]

.. note:: 
    However, it's crucial to note that due to the potential complexity of the user's local environment, installing ``learnware[full]`` does not guarantee that ``torch`` will successfully invoke ``CUDA`` in the user's local setting.

Prepare Learnware
====================

In the ``learnware`` package, each learnware is encapsulated in a ``zip`` package, which should contain at least the following four files:

- ``learnware.yaml``: learnware configuration file.
- ``__init__.py``: methods for using the model.
- ``stat.json``: the statistical specification of the learnware. Its filename can be customized and recorded in learnware.yaml.
- ``environment.yaml`` or ``requirements.txt``: specifies the environment for the model.

To facilitate the construction of a learnware, we provide a `Learnware Template <https://www.bmwu.cloud/static/learnware-template.zip>`_ that the users can use as a basis for building your own learnware.  We've also detailed the format of the learnware ``zip`` package in `Learnware Preparation <../workflows/upload:prepare-learnware>`_.

Learnware Package Workflow
============================

Users can start a ``Learnware`` workflow according to the following steps:

Initialize a Learnware Market
-------------------------------

The ``EasyMarket`` class provides the core functions of a ``Learnware Market``. 
You can initialize a basic ``Learnware Market`` named "demo" using the code snippet below:

.. code-block:: python
    
    from learnware.market import instantiate_learnware_market

    # instantiate a demo market
    demo_market = instantiate_learnware_market(market_id="demo", name="easy", rebuild=True) 


Upload Leanware
-------------------------------

Before uploading your learnware to the ``Learnware Market``, 
you'll need to create a semantic specification, ``semantic_spec``. This involves selecting or inputting values for predefined semantic tags 
to describe the features of your task and model.

For instance, the following codes illustrates the semantic specification for a Scikit-Learn type model. 
This model is tailored for education scenarios and performs classification tasks on tabular data:

.. code-block:: python

    from learnware.specification import generate_semantic_spec

    semantic_spec = generate_semantic_spec(
        name="demo_learnware",
        data_type="Table",
        task_type="Classification",
        library_type="Scikit-learn",
        scenarios="Education",
        license="MIT",
    )

After defining the semantic specification, 
you can upload your learnware using a single line of code:
    
.. code-block:: python

    demo_market.add_learnware(zip_path, semantic_spec) 

Here, ``zip_path`` is the directory of your learnware ``zip`` package.


Semantic Specification Search
-------------------------------

To find learnwares that align with your task's purpose, you'll need to provide a semantic specification, ``user_semantic``, that outlines your task's characteristics. 
The ``Learnware Market`` will then perform an initial search using ``user_semantic``, identifying potentially useful learnwares with models that solve tasks similar to your requirements.

.. code-block:: python

    # construct user_info which includes a semantic specification
    user_info = BaseUserInfo(id="user", semantic_spec=semantic_spec)

    # search_learnware: performs semantic specification search when user_info doesn't include a statistical specification
    search_result = easy_market.search_learnware(user_info) 
    single_result = search_results.get_single_results()

    # single_result: the List of Tuple[Score, Learnware] returned by semantic specification search
    print(single_result)
    

Statistical Specification Search
---------------------------------

If you decide in favor of porviding your own statistical specification file, ``stat.json``, 
the ``Learnware Market`` can further refine the selection of learnwares from the previous step. 
This second-stage search leverages statistical information to identify one or more learnwares that are most likely to be beneficial for your task. 

For example, the code below executes learnware search when using Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) as the statistical specification:

.. code-block:: python

    import learnware.specification as specification

    user_spec = specification.RKMETableSpecification()

    # unzip_path: directory for unzipped learnware zipfile
    user_spec.load(os.path.join(unzip_path, "rkme.json"))
    user_info = BaseUserInfo(
        semantic_spec=user_semantic, stat_info={"RKMETableSpecification": user_spec}
    )
    search_result = easy_market.search_learnware(user_info)

    single_result = search_results.get_single_results()
    multiple_result = search_results.get_multiple_results()

    # search_item.score: based on MMD distances, sorted in descending order
    # search_item.learnware.id: id of learnwares, sorted by scores in descending order
    for search_item in single_result:
        print(f"score: {search_item.score}, learnware_id: {search_item.learnware.id}")

    # mixture_item.learnwares: collection of learnwares whose combined use is beneficial
    # mixture_item.score: score assigned to the combined set of learnwares in `mixture_item.learnwares`
    for mixture_item in multiple_result:
        print(f"mixture_score: {mixture_item.score}\n")
        mixture_id = " ".join([learnware.id for learnware in mixture_item.learnwares])
        print(f"mixture_learnware: {mixture_id}\n")


Reuse Learnwares
-------------------------------

With the list of learnwares, ``mixture_learnware_list``, returned from the previous step, you can readily apply them to make predictions on your own data, bypassing the need to train a model from scratch. 
We offer provide two methods for reusing a given list of learnwares: ``JobSelectorReuser`` and ``AveragingReuser``. 
Just substitute ``test_x`` in the code snippet below with your own testing data, and you're all set to reuse learnwares:

.. code-block:: python

    from learnware.reuse import JobSelectorReuser, AveragingReuser

    # using jobselector reuser to reuse the searched learnwares to make prediction
    reuse_job_selector = JobSelectorReuser(learnware_list=mixture_item.learnwares)
    job_selector_predict_y = reuse_job_selector.predict(user_data=test_x)

    # using averaging ensemble reuser to reuse the searched learnwares to make prediction
    reuse_ensemble = AveragingReuser(learnware_list=mixture_item.learnwares)
    ensemble_predict_y = reuse_ensemble.predict(user_data=test_x)


We also provide two method when the user has labeled data for reusing a given list of learnwares: ``EnsemblePruningReuser`` and ``FeatureAugmentReuser``.
Just substitute ``test_x`` in the code snippet below with your own testing data, and substitute ``train_X, train_y`` with your own training labeled data, and you're all set to reuse learnwares:

.. code-block:: python

    from learnware.reuse import EnsemblePruningReuser, FeatureAugmentReuser

    # Use ensemble pruning reuser to reuse the searched learnwares to make prediction
    reuse_ensemble = EnsemblePruningReuser(learnware_list=mixture_item.learnwares, mode="classification")
    reuse_ensemble.fit(train_X, train_y)
    ensemble_pruning_predict_y = reuse_ensemble.predict(user_data=data_X)

    # Use feature augment reuser to reuse the searched learnwares to make prediction
    reuse_feature_augment = FeatureAugmentReuser(learnware_list=mixture_item.learnwares, mode="classification")
    reuse_feature_augment.fit(train_X, train_y)
    feature_augment_predict_y = reuse_feature_augment.predict(user_data=data_X)

Auto Workflow Example
============================

The ``Learnware`` also offers automated workflow examples. 
This includes preparing learnwares, uploading and deleting learnwares from the market, and searching for learnwares using both semantic and statistical specifications. 
To experience the basic workflow of the Learnware Market, please refer to `Learnware Examples <https://www.gitlink.org.cn/beimingwu/learnware/tree/main/examples>`_.
