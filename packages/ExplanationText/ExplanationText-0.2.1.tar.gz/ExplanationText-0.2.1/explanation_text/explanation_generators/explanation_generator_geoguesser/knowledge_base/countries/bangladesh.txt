Bangladesh can be broken into the urban and rural categories. Urban Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated areas in the world. There are often large numbers of people standing on the streets in Bangladesh, vehicles in a traffic jam and numerous rickshaws. Urban Bangladesh also features many shops crammed together along the sides of the roads with signs galore. As rural Bangladeshi Street View coverage mainly includes the more major roads connecting large Bangladeshi cities, the rural streets can still be crowded with vehicles. Rural Bangladesh stands out as the road is generally straight and almost always elevated above the land on both side of the road. There are typically trees lining the sides of the road and grassland beyond. There are often puddles of water on the low-lying grass flanking the road. The colours, red and white appear regularly in Bangladesh, on bollards, fences separating the road from water sources and on some curbs. The Bangladesh language of Bangala resembles Hindi but unlike Hindi, it regularly has triangles that point to the left. Bangladesh is one of the hardest countries in the world to pinpoint in, largely due to the lack of English signs. Bangladesh has a high population density and this is reflected with the streets often teeming with people. There are often buildings and shops lining the sides of the road with signs galore. The more rural parts of Bangladesh tend to have land on both sides of the road that is lower than the road itself. Trees also commonly line the road in rural Bangladeshi areas. Green grass is common on both sides of the road as are puddles and other forms of water. Rickshaws featuring a bike at the front and two wheels at the back are common across other parts of Asia but they are especially common in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi vehicles drive on the left. Most of the time, for civilian vehicles, Bangladeshi license plates are white for front and rear plates. Rickshaws in Bangladesh tend to have either green or white license plates. Bangladeshi bollards look like chimneys and are painted in alternating red and white sections. Sometimes the bollards are shorter than this image and thus have less red and white sections. As well as red and white bollards, Bangladeshi fences near water also feature these colours. Continuing Bangladeshâ€™s fixation with red and white, sometimes the curbs are also painted these colours. The most common road markings in Bangladesh involve white, continuous edge lines and a white, dashed, centre line. The Bangala written language that is widespread across Bangladesh reminds me of musical notes written beneath a horizontal line that runs on top. It is distinct from Hindi as it often has triangles that point to the left.

The turquoise and black licence plate can only be found in Bangladesh.

The Bengali language can easily be recognized by its horizontal lines.
