The limited coverage is centred around San Jose and the odd small section of Costa Rica such as a small part of the western coast.  A big clue in identifying Costa Rica is that you won’t be able to leave the footpath. You will also reach dead ends and will only be able to move in a narrow area. License plates in Costa Rica have a blue blur on both front and rear plates. The word ‘ALTO’ appears on stop signs in Costa Rica. Mexico and Guatemala also use the word ‘ALTO’ on their stop signs. Costa Rica’s landscape on Street View features lush, green vegetation. The roads appear high quality and well maintained.
