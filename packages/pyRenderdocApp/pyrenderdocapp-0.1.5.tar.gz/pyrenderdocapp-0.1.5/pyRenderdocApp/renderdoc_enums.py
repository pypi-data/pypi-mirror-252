    eRENDERDOC_Option_VerifyBufferAccess = 6
    """
    Verify buffer access. This includes checking the memory returned by a Map() call to
    detect any out-of-bounds modification, as well as initialising buffers with undefined contents
    to a marker value to catch use of uninitialised memory.

    NOTE: This option is only valid for OpenGL and D3D11. Explicit APIs such as D3D12 and Vulkan do
    not do the same kind of interception & checking and undefined contents are really undefined.

    Default - disabled

    NDERDOC_Option_VerifyMapWrites = eRENDERDOC_Option_VerifyBufferAccess,

    Hooks any system API calls that create child processes, and injects
    RenderDoc into them recursively with the same options.

    Default - disabled

     - 1 - Hooks into spawned child processes
     - 0 - Child processes are not hooked by RenderDoc
    """

    eRENDERDOC_Option_RefAllResources = 8
    """
    By default RenderDoc only includes resources in the final capture necessary
    for that frame, this allows you to override that behaviour.

    Default - disabled

     - 1 - all live resources at the time of capture are included in the capture
       and available for inspection
     - 0 - only the resources referenced by the captured frame are included
    """

    eRENDERDOC_Option_SaveAllInitials = 9
    """
    **NOTE**: As of RenderDoc v1.1 this option has been deprecated. Setting or
    getting it will be ignored, to allow compatibility with older versions.
    In v1.1 the option acts as if it's always enabled.

    By default RenderDoc skips saving initial states for resources where the
    previous contents don't appear to be used, assuming that writes before
    reads indicate previous contents aren't used.

    Default - disabled

     - 1 - initial contents at the start of each captured frame are saved, even if
       they are later overwritten or cleared before being used.
     - 0 - unless a read is detected, initial contents will not be saved and will
       appear as black or empty data.
    """

    eRENDERDOC_Option_CaptureAllCmdLists = 10
    """
    In APIs that allow for the recording of command lists to be replayed later,
    RenderDoc may choose to not capture command lists before a frame capture is
    triggered, to reduce overheads. This means any command lists recorded once
    and replayed many times will not be available and may cause a failure to
    capture.

    NOTE: This is only true for APIs where multithreading is difficult or
    discouraged. Newer APIs like Vulkan and D3D12 will ignore this option
    and always capture all command lists since the API is heavily oriented
    around it and the overheads have been reduced by API design.

    - 1 - All command lists are captured from the start of the application
    - 0 - Command lists are only captured if their recording begins during
      the period when a frame capture is in progress.
    """

    eRENDERDOC_Option_DebugOutputMute = 11
    """
    Mute API debugging output when the API validation mode option is enabled

    Default - enabled

    1 - Mute any API debug messages from being displayed or passed through
    0 - API debugging is displayed as normal
    """

    eRENDERDOC_Option_AllowUnsupportedVendorExtensions = 12
    """
    Option to allow vendor extensions to be used even when they may be
    incompatible with RenderDoc and cause corrupted replays or crashes.

    Default - inactive

    No values are documented, this option should only be used when absolutely
    necessary as directed by a RenderDoc developer.
    """

    eRENDERDOC_Option_SoftMemoryLimit = 13
    """
    Define a soft memory limit which some APIs may aim to keep overhead under where
    possible. Anything above this limit will where possible be saved directly to disk during
    capture.
    This will cause increased disk space use (which may cause a capture to fail if disk space is
    exhausted) as well as slower capture times.

    Not all memory allocations may be deferred like this so it is not a guarantee of a memory
    limit.

    Units are in MBs, suggested values would range from 200MB to 1000MB.

    Default - 0 Megabytes
