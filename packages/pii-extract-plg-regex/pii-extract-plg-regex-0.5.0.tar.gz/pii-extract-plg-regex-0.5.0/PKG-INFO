# Pii Extractor plugin: regex


This repository builds a Python package that installs a pii-extract-base
plugin to performs PII detection for text data based on regular expressions
(with optional context). The name of the plugin entry point is 
`piisa-detectors-regex`.

The PII Tasks in the package are structured by language & country, since many
of the PII elements are language- and/or -country dependent.


## Requirements

The package
 * needs at least Python 3.8
 * needs the pii-data and the pii-extract-base base packages
 * uses the regex package (instead of the standard `re` package in the core
   Python library)
 * uses the python-stdnum package to validate many identifiers (and the 
   python-phonenumbers to validate phone numbers)


## Usage

The package does not have any user-facing entry points, and it is used
automatically by the PIISA framework.


## Building

The provided Makefile can be used to process the package:
 * `make pkg` will build the Python package, creating a file that can be
   installed with `pip`
 * `make unit` will launch all unit tests (using pytest, so pytest must be
   available)
 * `make install` will install the package in a Python virtualenv. The
   virtualenv will be chosen as, in this order:
     - the one defined in the `VENV` environment variable, if it is defined
     - if there is a virtualenv activated in the shell, it will be used
     - otherwise, a default is chosen as `/opt/venv/bigscience` (it will be
       created if it does not exist)
