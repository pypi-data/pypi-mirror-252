class Meter:
    """ Class module to abstract meters in the Wirepas network and to query these.

    It manages the meter configurations and, especially, it handles the ciphering settings
    that are used to encrypt/decrypt messages exchanged with a meter in all association modes.
    It also provides methods to connect to, to query the meters and to parse their responses.
    All request methods can be used as is to query values from the meter,
    and they will return a Response object possessing the response error code,
    the meter response payload, the value that was queried and
    the xml representation of the response message.

    The meter requests in pass-through do not need any application association establishment.
    But, the establish_AA_NIC method should be used to establish the association with the NIC
    before doing queries to the NIC server and the release_AA_NIC method should be used at the end of the exchange
    to free the meter association with the NIC. The pass-through requests might not work
    if a NIC association is established but not released.

    For example, the following code can be used to query a meter in pass-through:

    .. code-block:: python

        response = meter.get_meter_device_ID()
        if response.error_code == ErrorCodeEnum.RES_OK:
            print(f"The device ID of the meter is {response.value}")


    Plus, the following code can be used to provision a meter:

    .. code-block:: python

        if meter.establish_AA_NIC():
            result = meter.set_NIC_security_material_from_config(configuration)
            if result.error_code == ErrorCodeEnum.RES_OK:
                print(f"The meter has been provisioned!")
            meter.release_AA_NIC()

    Notes:

    * All DLMS requests methods containing "NIC" in their name are sent to the NIC and \
        the DLMS requests methods containing "meter" in their name are sent in passthrough.
    * establish_AA_NIC and release_AA_NIC are the only methods sending DLMS requests \
        that return boolean. The others return a Response object.
    * DLMS requests in passthrough create/set automatically a new client before generating the payload.
    * establish_AA_NIC method creates/sets a new client that will only handle the NIC requests. \
        This client is destroyed on release of the association.
