# PyCBCount
PyCBCount is a Python package designed to calculate various metrics from Complete Blood Count (CBC) tests. This package provides functionalities to compute key hematological parameters such as Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV), Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH), and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), among others. It also includes reference ranges for a comprehensive list of CBC metrics across different age groups.

## Installation
To install pycbcount, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pycbcount
```

## Usage
Here is how you can use the pycbcount package:

```python
import pycbcount as cbc
from pycbcount import reference_range

# Calculate MCV
mcv_value = cbc.mcv(hct=0.45, rbc=5.2e6)

# Calculate MCH
mch_value = cbc.mch(hb=14, rbc=5.2e6)

# Adult reference range for MCV and MCH
reference_range["Adult"]["MCV"]
reference_range["Adult"]["MCH"]

# Adult age reference range for MCH and MCH
reference_range[18]["MCV"]
reference_range[18]["MCH"]
```

## Features
- Calculation of MCV, MCH, MCHC, NLR, ANC, and ALC.
- Reference ranges for WBC, RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW, PLT, Neutrophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, Eosinophils, and Basophils.
