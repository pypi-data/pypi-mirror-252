# README for PCSorter

## Introduction

PCSorter is a Python-based utility designed to intelligently organize files in a directory using the OpenAI ChatGPT API. This tool scans a specified directory (including subdirectories if desired), classifies files based on content and type, and reorganizes them into a more structured format. It leverages the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models to understand and categorize file contents, making file management more efficient and intuitive.

Key Features:
- File sorting using AI-driven insights.
- Customizable directory and file type handling.
- Backup and restore functionality for sorted files.
- Cross-platform compatibility with detailed setup instructions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `openai` Python package
- Additional Python libraries: `os`, `re`, `shutil`, `time`, `argparse`, `datetime`, `json`, `sys`
- An active OpenAI API key

## Installation Instructions

1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
2. Clone the PCSorter repository from GitHub or download the source code.
3. Navigate to the PCSorter directory in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Install required Python packages using the command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Set up an environment variable for your OpenAI API key (instructions in the next section).

### Setting Up Environment Variables

#### Windows

1. **Command Prompt:**
   - Use `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "Your-API-Key"` to set the API key.
2. **PowerShell:**
   - Apply `$env:OPENAI_API_KEY = "Your-API-Key"` to set the key.
3. **Editing System Properties:**
   - Open System Properties -> Advanced -> Environment Variables.
   - Add a new System variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your API key as its value.

#### macOS

1. **Using Terminal:**
   - Add `export OPENAI_API_KEY="Your-API-Key"` to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`.
2. **Editing `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`:**
   - Open these files in a text editor and add the export line as above.

#### Linux

1. **Using Terminal:**
   - Similar to macOS, use `export OPENAI_API_KEY="Your-API-Key"` in `.bashrc` or equivalent.
2. **Editing `.bashrc` or equivalent:**
   - Open the file in an editor and add the export command.

## Configuration

Before running PCSorter, ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable is set. Adjust the script settings in `main.py` if necessary, to change default behavior (e.g., default model, directory).

## Usage Instructions

1. **Running the script:**
   - Execute `python main.py` in your terminal.
   - Use command-line arguments to specify options like `--model`, `--dir`, `--include`, `--backup`.
2. **Common use cases:**
   - Sorting files in the current directory: `python main.py sort --dir ./my_directory`
   - Using a specific GPT model: `python main.py sort --model gpt-3.5-turbo`

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Not Recognized:** Ensure the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY` is correctly set.
- **Permission Errors:** Run the script with appropriate permissions or from a non-restricted directory.
- **Invalid Model Specified:** Check that the model name is correct and supported.

## FAQs

- **Can PCSorter handle large directories?**
  Yes, but performance may vary based on the number and size of files.
