ERROR    HTTPError: 403 Forbidden from https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
         Username/Password authentication is no longer supported. Migrate to API Tokens or Trusted Publishers
         instead. See https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken and https://pypi.org/help/#trusted-publishers

You can create a token for an entire PyPI account, in which case, the token will work for all projects associated with that account. Alternatively, you can limit a token's scope to a specific project. 

To use an API token:
    Set your username to __token__
    Set your password to the token value, including the pypi- prefix

        激活 Two factor authentication (2FA)
        Two-factor authentication (2FA) makes your account more secure by requiring two things in order to log in: something you know and something you own. 
        Two-factor authentication is required on your PyPI account.
