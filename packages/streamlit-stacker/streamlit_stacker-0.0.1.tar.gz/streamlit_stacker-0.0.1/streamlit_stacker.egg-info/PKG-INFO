# streamlit_stacker

streamlit_stacker is a python package implementing a main st_stacker class.
This class can be used with similar syntax as the streamlit module but the calls to commands will be stacked and rendered latter in a controlable manner.

Useful to implement dynamic execution of streamlit commands in an interactive console interface.
Supports (almost) all streamlit methods

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install streamlit_stacker
```

## Usage

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_stacker import st_stacker

#shortcut
state=st.session_state

#define the stacker in state
if not 'stacker' in state:
    state.stacker=st_stacker()
stk=state.stacker

#resets all commands in the stacker to a non-rendered state, so that the next call to refresh will render them again
stk.reset()

if not 'test' in state:
    #stack a chat message, won't be rendered immediately
    with stk.chat_message():
        stk.write("Hello!")
    state.test=True

#render the stack: the chat message will appear on screen on every rerun, even though the corresponding commands have been called only once at first run
stk.refresh()


```
