    """
    Performs Initial Contact Detection (ICD) on low back IMU accelerometer data for detecting initial contacts (ICs).

    Args:
        imu_acceleration (numpy.ndarray): Input IMU accelerometer data (N, 3) for x, y, and z axes.
        gait_sequences (list): List of dictionaries containing gait sequence 'Start' and 'End' fields.
        sampling_frequency (float, optional): Sampling frequency of the accelerometer data. Default is 100 Hz.
        plot_results (bool, optional): If True, generates a plot showing the results. Default is False.

    Returns:
        processed_output (list): List of dictionaries containing detected ICs and associated information.

    Description:
        This function implements the Initial Contact Detection Algorithm (ICDA) on accelerometer data
        collected from a low back sensor. The purpose of ICD is to identify and characterize initial contacts
        within the walking bouts.

        The algorithm takes accelerometer data as input, specifically the vertical acceleration component,
        and processes each specified gait sequence independently. The input accelerometer data should be
        provided as a numpy.ndarray with shape (N, 3), where N is the number of data points.
        The three columns represent the acceleration along the x, y, and z axes. Gait sequences are provided
        as a list of dictionaries with 'Start' and 'End' fields indicating the start and end times of each sequence.
        The sampling frequency of the accelerometer data is also required.

        The algorithm is applied to a pre-processed vertical acceleration signal recorded on the lower back.
        This signal is first detrended and then low-pass filtered. The resulting signal is numerically integrated
        and differentiated using a Gaussian continuous wavelet transformation. The initial contact (IC) events
        are identified as the positive maximal peaks between successive zero-crossings.
