`canny` creates a clickable pane, based on the standard input.

or more precise:  
  
`canny` reads lines from STDIN, allowing you to interactively select a value, which is then returned to STDOUT.

* canny enables interactive filters in piped commands
* a unix-philosophy experiment
* brings the mouse to the cli :)
* a fzf inspired tool

**But, what does it do?**  
- Every non-white space becomes a token
- Every token will be possible element for selection
- After a selection, the token will be returned through standard output

## Usage
Here are some examples, after the [installation step](#installation)  

This will open the selected file/directory of the current directory in vim:
```sh
vim $(ls -C | canny)
```

Another possible usage is this:
```sh
ls -C | canny | xargs xdg-open
```
This opens the selected file with it's standard application.

For more ways to use `canny` check out the `examples` directory.  

### Html Parser
- when run with the `--tags` flag, canny will look for HTML tags (excluding semantics) and makes tag bodies clickable.
- this function allows for a predefinition of clickable elements, in contrast to the default case, where every non-whitespace character is clickable
- if the tags are nested, only the highest level of tags is clickable
- in the case ther are no tags in the text, every word will be tokenized and clickable.
