## How to get started?
We have prepared a very detailed documentation guide available at [readthedocs](https://pytomography.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Some Technical Aspects
PyTomography uses the functionality of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to:
 1. Enable fast GPU-accelerated reconstruction 
 2. Permit easy integration of deep-learning models in traditional reconstruction algorithms.
