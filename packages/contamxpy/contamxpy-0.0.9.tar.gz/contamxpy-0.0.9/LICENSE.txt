CONTAM
This software was developed at the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology by employees of the Federal Government in the course 
of their official duties. Pursuant to title 17 Section 105 of the 
United States Code this software is not subject to copyright 
protection and is in the public domain. CONTAM is an experimental 
system. NIST assumes no responsibility whatsoever for its use by 
other parties, and makes no guarantees, expressed or implied, about 
its quality, reliability, or any other characteristic. We would 
appreciate acknowledgement if the software is used. This software 
can be redistributed and/or modified freely provided that any 
derivative works bear some notice that they are derived from it, 
and any modified versions bear some notice that they have been modified.

Users are warned that CONTAM is intended for use only by persons 
competent in the field of airflow and contaminant dispersal in 
buildings and is intended only to supplement the judgement of the 
qualified user. The computer program described in this report is a 
prototype methodology for computing the airflows and contaminant 
migration in a building. The calculations are based upon a 
simplified model of the complexity of real buildings. These 
simplifications must be understood and considered by the user.

Certain trade names and company products are mentioned in the text 
or identified in an illustration in order to adequately specify the 
equipment used. In no case does such an identification imply 
recommendation or endorsement by the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology, nor does it imply that the products are necessarily 
the best available for the purpose.
