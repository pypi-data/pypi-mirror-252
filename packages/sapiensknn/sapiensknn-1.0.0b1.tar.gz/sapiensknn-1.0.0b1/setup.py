The returned value for classification will always be one of the labels from the learning DataSet. If the value of the parameter K is greater than 1, the class that is most repeated among the nearest neighbors represented in K will be returned. Although the algorithm's primary focus is on data classification, it can also potentially be used for regression by returning the average of the values of the selected neighbors with the parameter K.",
