    Run Babai's Nearest Plane algorithm by running LLL.

    :param B: Input lattice basis.
    :param target: Target point (âˆˆ ZZ^n)
    :returns coordinates of the solution vector:

    This implementation is more numerically stable compared to the one offered by `MatGSO.babai()`.
    On the other hand, this implementation will only accept tatgets with Integer coefficients.

    EXAMPLE ::

       >>> from fpylll import *
       >>> n = 10
       >>> B = IntegerMatrix(n, n + 1)
       >>> B.randomize("intrel", bits=100)
       >>> v_opt = B.multiply_left([1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1])
       >>> s = v_opt[0] # s = <a, x>, where a is vector of knapsack values.
       >>> t = [s] + (n * [0])
       >>> v = CVP.babai(B, t)
       >>> v[0] == t[0]
       True
