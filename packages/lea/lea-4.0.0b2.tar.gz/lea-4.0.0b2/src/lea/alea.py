    Alea is a Lea subclass, which instance is defined by explicit probability distribution data.
    An Alea instance is defined by given value-probability pairs, that is an explicit probability
    mass function (pmf). The probabilities can be expressed as any object with arithmetic semantic.
    The main candidates are float, fraction or symbolic expressions.
    An Alea instance is an "elementary pex", as defined in the paper on Statues algorithm
    (see http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09997).
