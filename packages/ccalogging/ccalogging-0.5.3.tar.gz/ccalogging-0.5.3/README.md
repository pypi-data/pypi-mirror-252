# CCA Logging
Easy python logging module

## Installing
[Install from pypi](https://pypi.org/project/ccalogging/)
```
# install into users system site-packages
pip install ccalogging --user
```

```
# install into a virtual environment
pip install ccalogging
```

```
# as part of your own package, add to setup.py
setup(
    ...,
    install_requires=[
        '...',
        'ccalogging',
        '...',
        ],
    ...,
)
```

## Usage
Import this module, set logging output, optionally set logging level,
set a script level variable pointing to this modules `log` variable,
then issue log.debug() etc.

You only need to set the output destination and logging level once, so
if you have multiple files in your project, set the output destination
and the logging level in the first one.  In all the others just point a
script level variable to `ccalogging.log`.

When using a log file, if the file already exists, new log messages are appended
to it.

The default logging level is WARNING.

```
# first (or only) project file

import ccalogging          # import the module

ccalogging.setConsoleOut() # set global logging destination
ccalogging.setDebug()      # set global log level
log = ccalogging.log       # point a script-level variable to the logger

log.info("Logging has been started")
```

```
# subsequent project files

import ccalogging    # import the module

log = ccalogging.log # point a script-level variable to the logger

log.warning("continuing to log to the same location as setup in the first file")
```

## Options
It is possible to log to the console and/or to a file. When logging to the
console logs go to `stderr` by default.

### setDebug()
Sets the global loglevel to be logging.DEBUG

### setInfo()
Sets the global loglevel to be logging.INFO

### setWarn()
Sets the global loglevel to be logging.WARNING.
This is the default level, if you don't set a level.

### setError()
Sets the global loglevel to be logging.ERROR

### setLogFile(fqfn)
Sends log output to a file

  parameters:

  `fqfn`: the fully qualified path name of the log file

  `fformat`: message format - defaults to: `"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)-5.5s]  %(message)s"`

  `datefmt`: date format - defaults to: `"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"`

  `rotation`: default: None - set this to the number of days to keep the log file for
                              older logs will be compressed and numbered (up to this value)

### setConsoleOut()
Sends log output to the console

  parameters:

  `STDOUT`: if `True` send to `stdout` - defaults to False (`stderr`)

  `cformat`: message format - defaults to: `"%(asctime)s [%(levelname)-5.5s]  %(message)s"`

  `datefmt`: date format - defaults to: `"%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S"`
