This library allows you to compare student submissions to an answer, and provide
meaningful feedback. It currently accommodates basic Python data structures, `pandas`
Series and DataFrames, `scikit-learn` models, and images.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install grading-tools
```

## Usage

```python
>>> from grading_tools.graders import PythonGrader
>>> sub = {"snake": "reptile", "frog": "reptile"}
>>> ans = {"snake": "reptile", "frog": "amphibian"}
>>> g = PythonGrader(sub, ans)
>>> g.grade_dict()
>>> g.return_feedback(html=False)
{
    'score': 0,
    'passed': False,
    'comment': "The value for the key `frog` doesn't match the expected result."
}
```
