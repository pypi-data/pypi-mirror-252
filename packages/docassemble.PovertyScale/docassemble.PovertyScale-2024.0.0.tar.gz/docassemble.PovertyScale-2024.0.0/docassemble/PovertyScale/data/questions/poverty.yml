  Multiplier specific to MA courts, for affidavit of indigency.
  
  You can override in your own interview.
code: |  
  poverty_multiplier = 1.25 # threshold multiplier. e.g. 2 for 200%

  A table you can insert into your interview that shows the household
  size and corresponding income limit up to a household of size 10.
  
  E.g., ${ poverty_scale_table }
table: poverty_scale_table
rows: |
  [DAObject(household_size=n, limit=(poverty_base) + (n*poverty_multiplier*poverty_increment)) for n in range(1,11)]
columns:
  - ${ ma_poverty_household_size_template }: |
      row_item.household_size
  - ${ ma_poverty_income_limit_template }: |
      currency(row_item.limit)
