# datasets.py

"""
Quick example datasets for use in ``hiveplotlib``.

For Hive Plots, many excellent network datasets are available online, including many graphs that can be generated using
`networkx <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generators.html>`_ and
`pytorch-geometric <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/data_cheatsheet.html#>`_.
The `Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection <https://snap.stanford.edu/data/>`_ is also a great general source of
network datasets. If working with ``networkx`` graphs,
users can also take advantage of the ``hiveplotlib.converters.networkx_to_nodes_edges()`` method to quickly get those
graphs into a ``hiveplotlib``-ready format.

For Polar Parallel Coordinates Plots (P2CPs), many datasets are available through packages including
`statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/datasets/index.html>`_ and
`scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets.html>`_.

    Read in international trade data network from the Harvard Growth Lab.

    .. note::
        Only a limited number of subsets of the data are shipped with ``hiveplotlib``, as each year of trade data is
        roughly 300mb. However, the raw data are available at the
        `Harvard Growth Lab's website <https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/T4CHWJ>`_, and the runner to produce the necessary
        files to use this reader function is available in the
        `repository <https://gitlab.com/geomdata/hiveplotlib/-/blob/master/runners/make_trade_network_dataset.py>`_
        (``make_trade_network_dataset.py``).

        If you are using the runner to make your own trade datasets that you will read in locally with this
        function, then you will need to specify the local ``path`` accordingly.

    :param year: which year of data to pull. If the year of data is not available, an error will be raised.
    :param hs92_code: which HS 92 code of export data to pull. If the code requested is not available, an error will
        be raised. There are different numbers of digits (e.g. 2, 4), where more digits leads to more specificity of
        trade group. For a reference to what trade groups these codes correspond to, see

        you saved both the data and metadata files (which must be in the same directory).
