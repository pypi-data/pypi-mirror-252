    ``matplotlib`` visualization of constructed edges in a ``HivePlot`` or ``P2CP`` instance using ``datashader``.

    The main idea of ``datashader`` is rather than plot all the lines on top of each other in a figure, one can instead
    essentially build up a single 2d image of the lines in 2-space. We can then plot just this rasterization, which is
    much smaller. By using the default reduction function ``reduction=ds.count`` (counting values in bins),
    we are essentially building a 2d histogram. For more on reductions in ``datashader``, see the
    `datashader documentation <https://datashader.org/getting_started/Pipeline.html#d-reductions>`__, and for a complete
    list of reduction functions available, see the
    `datashader API docs <https://datashader.org/api.html#reductions>`__.

    .. note::
        A high ``dpi`` value is recommended when datashading to allow for more nuance in the rasterization. This is why
        this visualization function defaults to a ``dpi`` value of 300 when ``fig=None`` and ``ax=None``.

        Experimentation with different (low) values for ``pixel_spread`` is encouraged. As the name suggests, this
        parameter spreads out calculated pixel values in the rasterization radially. Values that are too low tends to
        result in the thinner, more isolated curves "breaking apart" in the final visualization. For more on spreading,
        see the `datashader documentation <https://datashader.org/getting_started/Pipeline.html#spreading>`__.

    :param instance: ``HivePlot`` or ``P2CP`` instance for which we want to draw edges.
    :param tag: which tag of data to plot. If ``None`` is provided, then plotting will occur if there is only one tag
        in the instance. For more on data tags, see further discussion in the Comparing Network Subgroups
        `Notebook <https://geomdata.gitlab.io/hiveplotlib/comparing_network_subgroups.html#Lower-level-Functionality>`_.
    :param cmap: which colormap to use for the datashaded edges. Default is a ``seaborn`` colormap similar to the
        ``matplotlib`` ``"Blues"`` colormap.
    :param vmin: minimum value used in the colormap for plotting the rasterization of curves. Default 1.
    :param vmax: maximum value used in the colormap for plotting the rasterization of curves. Default ``None`` finds and
        uses the maximum bin value of the calculated rasterization.
    :param log_cmap: whether to use a logarithmic (base 10) scale for the colormap. Default ``True``.
    :param reduction: the means of projecting from data space to pixel space for the rasterization. Default
        ``ds.count()`` essentially builds a 2d histogram. For more on reductions in ``datashader``, see the
        `datashader documentation <https://datashader.org/getting_started/Pipeline.html#d-reductions>`__, and for a
        complete list of reduction functions available, see the
        `datashader API docs <https://datashader.org/api.html#reductions>`__.
    :param pixel_spread: amount of pixel units in which to "spread" pixel values in the resulting rasterization before
        plotting. Default amount of spreading is 2 pixels. For more on spreading,
        see the `datashader documentation <https://datashader.org/getting_started/Pipeline.html#spreading>`__.
    :param buffer: fraction of the axes past which to buffer x and y dimensions (e.g. setting ``buffer`` to 0.1 will
        find the maximum radius spanned by any ``Axis`` instance and set the x and y bounds as
        ``(-max_radius - buffer * max_radius, max_radius + buffer * max_radius)``).
    :param fig: default ``None`` builds new figure. If a figure is specified, ``Axis`` instances will be
        drawn on that figure. Note: ``fig`` and ``ax`` must BOTH be ``None`` to instantiate new figure and axes.
    :param ax: default ``None`` builds new axis. If an axis is specified, ``Axis`` instances will be drawn on that
        axis. Note: ``fig`` and ``ax`` must BOTH be ``None`` to instantiate new figure and axes.
    :param figsize: size of figure. Note: only works if instantiating new figure and axes (e.g. ``fig`` and ``ax`` are
        ``None``).
    :param dpi: resolution (Dots Per Inch) of resulting figure. A higher-than-usual DPI is recommended to show more
        pixels in the final rasterization, which will show more nuance.
    :param mpl_axes_off: whether to turn off Cartesian x, y axes in resulting ``matplotlib`` figure (default ``True``
        hides the x and y axes).
    :param fig_kwargs: additional values to be called in ``plt.subplots()`` call. Note if ``figsize`` is added here,
        then it will be prioritized over the ``figsize`` parameter.
    :param im_kwargs: additional params that will be applied to the final ``plt.imshow()`` call on the rasterization.

        hides the x and y axes).
    :param buffer: fraction of the axes past which to buffer x and y dimensions (e.g. setting ``buffer`` to 0.1 will
        find the maximum radius spanned by any ``Axis`` instance and set the x and y bounds as
        ``(-max_radius - buffer * max_radius, max_radius + buffer * max_radius)``).
    :param show_axes_labels: whether to label the hive plot axes in the figure (uses ``Axis.long_name`` for each
        ``Axis``.)
    :param axes_labels_buffer: fraction which to radially buffer axes labels (e.g. setting ``axes_label_buffer`` to 1.1
        will be 10% further past the end of the axis moving from the origin of the plot).
    :param axes_labels_fontsize: font size for hive plot axes labels.
    :param axes_kwargs: additional params that will be applied to all axes. Note, these are kwargs that affect
        a ``plt.plot()`` call.
    :param text_kwargs: additional kwargs passed to ``plt.text()`` call.
    :param fig_kwargs: additional values to be called in ``plt.subplots()`` call. Note if ``figsize`` is added here,
        then it will be prioritized over the ``figsize`` parameter.
    :param im_kwargs: additional params that will be applied to the final ``plt.imshow()`` call on the rasterization.
    :return: ``matplotlib`` figure, axis, the image corresponding to node data, and the image corresponding to edge
        data.
