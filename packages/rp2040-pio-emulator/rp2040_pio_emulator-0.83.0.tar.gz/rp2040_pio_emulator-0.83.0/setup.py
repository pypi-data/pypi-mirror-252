It is designed\nto assist in the analysis of PIO programs and to help you by:\n\n* Enabling unit tests to be written.\n* Answering questions such as: How many clock cycles are being consumed?\n* Supporting the visualization of GPIO outputs over time.\n* Providing alternatives to debugging on real hardware, which can be time consuming.\n\n## Quick Start\nBelow is a slight variation of the example used within the [Quick Start Guide](./docs/Quick%20Start%20Guide.md).\n\n```python\nfrom pioemu import emulate\n\nprogram = [0xE029, 0x0041, 0x2080]  # Count down from 9 using X register\n\ngenerator = emulate(program, stop_when=lambda _, state: state.x_register < 0)\n\nfor before, after in generator:\n  print(f"X register: {before.x_register} -> {after.x_register}")\n```\n\n## Documentation\nA [Tour of pioemu](./docs/Tour%20of%20pioemu.md) provides a more detailed explanation than the\n[Quick Start Guide](./docs/Quick%20Start%20Guide.md) offers. In addition, there is a\n[FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md) available that might contain an answer to your question. However, if none\nof these provides you with the necessary information then please consider creating a\n[new issue](https://github.com/NathanY3G/rp2040-pio-emulator/issues) - thanks!\n\n## Additional Examples\nSome additional examples include:\n\n1. Visualisation of square wave program using Jupyter Notebooks within the `examples/` directory.\n\n1. TDD example for the Pimoroni Blinkt! within the `examples/` directory.\n\n1. [pico-pio-examples](https://github.com/NathanY3G/pico-pio-examples)\n\n## Supported Instructions\n\nInstruction | Supported                         | Notes\n:-----------| :---------------------------------| :----\nJMP         | :heavy_check_mark:                | \nWAIT        | :heavy_check_mark: :warning:      | IRQ variant is not supported\nIN          | :heavy_check_mark:                |\nOUT         | :heavy_check_mark: :construction: | EXEC destination not implemented\nPUSH        | :heavy_check_mark:                | \nPULL        | :heavy_check_mark:                | \nMOV         | :heavy_check_mark: :construction: | Some variants and operations not implemented\nIRQ         | :heavy_multiplication_x:          |\nSET         | :heavy_check_mark:                |\n\n## Known Limitations\nThis software is under development and currently has limitations - the notable ones are:\n\n1. Not all of the available instructions are supported - please refer to the table above.\n\n1. No support for pin-sets associated with OUT, SET or IN; all pin numbers are with respect to GPIO 0.\n\n1. Pin-sets do not wrap after GPIO 31.\n\n1. No direct support for the concurrent running of multiple PIO programs;\n   a single State Machine is emulated and not an entire PIO block.\n\n## Thanks To\n* [aaronjamt](https://github.com/aaronjamt) for contributing features and fixes.\n* [Josverl](https://github.com/Josverl) for contributing features.\n* [winnylourson](https://github.com/winnylourson) for contributing a bug fix.\n',
