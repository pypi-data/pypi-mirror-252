        Create an independent copy of the environment and any contained objects (actor, sub-environments).

        Copying uses `copy.deepcopy` by default. You can simply use this implementation for
        any subclassses, unless they refer to large, effectively
        immutable objects (e.g. the weights of a local language model),
        or refer to non-copyable objects (e.g. server sockets or database connections).
        Note that those references may be indirect.

        In those cases, you may want to modify the deepcopy behavior around that object, or disable
        deep-copying of this object. See the documentation of `interlab.utis.checked_deepcopy` and the documentation
        of [`__deepcopy__`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) for details.
        NB that overriding this method (`copy`) will not affect deep-copying of this object when contained
        in other copied objects!

        Note that e.g. langchain API models are thin wrappers that are cheap to copy, and e.g.
        individual `MemoryItem`s are already not duplicated upon copying the actor and its memory.
        Also note that strings are immutable in Python and so are also not duplicated.
