# MLGO Python Utilities

This folder contains MLGO Python utilities, particularly infrastructure
to help enable ML applications within LLVM, especially tooling to extract
corpora that can be used in downstream projects to train ML models and perform
other tasks that benefit from having a large amount of data.

### Python Versioning

Due to type annotations, the MLGO tooling currently only supports a Python
version greater than 3.8, deviating from the current LLVM project-wide
minimum supported version of Python 3.6.
