        ```python
        
        import time
        import openapi_client
        from openapi_client.rest import ApiException
        from pprint import pprint
        
        # Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://events.withvayu.com
        # See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.

            host = "https://events.withvayu.com"
        )
        
        
        
        # Enter a context with an instance of the API client
        with openapi_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
            # Create an instance of the API class
            api_instance = openapi_client.AuthApi(api_client)
            login_request = openapi_client.LoginRequest() # LoginRequest | The body contains the refresh token required to obtain a new access token.
        
            try:
                # Login by obtaining a new access token
                api_response = api_instance.login(login_request)
                print("The response of AuthApi->login:\n")
                pprint(api_response)
            except ApiException as e:
